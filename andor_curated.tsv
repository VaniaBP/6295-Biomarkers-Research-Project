NTRK1 LMNA::NTRK1 G595R	1256	Colorectal Adenocarcinoma	50861	Predictive	"A gene fusion between exon 10 of NTRK1 and exon 11 of the LMNA genes was observed in a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer after therapy with first-line FOLFOX, second-line FOLFIRI/cetuximab, and third-line irinotecan. The patient treated in a clinical trial with pan-TRK kinase inhibitor entrectinib. Treatment was well tolerated and led to a partial response (PR) with 30% tumor shrinkage of multiple liver metastases. Clinical response lasted 4 months. Longitudinal analysis of ctDNA in plasma samples revealed a p.G595R- and p.G667C mutation in NTRK1 that were absent before treatment initiation but  emerged 4 weeks upon initiation of treatment with entrectinib. These mutations were also validated using xenograft, in vitro and 3D-modeling."	26546295

PIK3CA H1047L	3634	Breast Tubular Carcinoma	6587	Prognostic	"In a retrospective analysis of 32 Western Chinese female patients with invasive ductal breast cancer, PIK3CA H1047L (n=1) or H1047R (n=8) was associated with worse survival and increased incidence of lymph node invasion. The incidence of lymph node invasion was 15/23 (65%) for the PIK3CA wildtype population and 7/9 (78%) for the subset of patients whose tumors harbored PIK3CA H1047L or H1047R. Authors note that age, tumor grade, tumor size, number of lymphatic nodes and IHC results did not show significant difference between PIK3CA-mutated and non-mutated samples."	28269754

PIK3CA Exon 10 mutation	1867	Colorectal Cancer	9256	Prognostic	"This was a prospective study involving 1,170 colorectal cancer patients confirmed by histology. PIK3CA mutations were found in 16% (189/1170) of cased via pyrosequencing of FFPE samples, of these 58% (109/189) had mutations in exon 10, 39% (73/189) had mutations in exon 21, and 3.7% (7/189) had mutations in both exons. Study found that exon 10 + exon 21 mutants were associated with shorter cancer specific survival and overall survival when compared to WT PIK3CA (P = 0.031, P = 0.0008). These mutants were also associated with higher colorectal cancer-specific mortality and overall mortality (multivariate hazard ratio (HR) = 3.51, multivariate HR 2.68). In contrast, mutations on either exon 10 or exon 21 alone were not statistically significant in terms of overall survival. Note that exons 10 and 21 are listed as exons 9 and 20 in the source, as it was common at the time of its publication to exclude non-coding exon 1. Authors note that they had limited data on cancer treatment data, but assume that treatment regimens did not differ substantially based on PIK3CA mutation status given that patients were diagnosed prior to clinical availability of PIK3CA genotype data. They further note that treatment decisions were typically based on cancer stage, for which their analyses adjusted."	22357840

PIK3CA Exon 10 mutation	3179	Rectum Cancer	1993	Prognostic	"This study examined outcomes of 240 rectum cancer patients treated with total mesorectal excision therapy. Tumor samples were obtained at the time of surgery and genotyped for PIK3CA mutations in exons 10 and 21 (listed as exons 9 and 20 in the source, as it was common to exclude non-coding exon 1). PIK3CA mutations were identified in 19 cases (12 in exon 10 and 7 in exon 21). PIK3CA mutations were associated with a 3-fold increase in risk of recurrence of rectal tumors (5-year risk: 27.8% vs 9.4%, p = 0.008). Furthermore, patients with PIK3CA mutations experienced a shorter time to recurrence compared to those with WT PIK3CA (median: 7.9 vs 19.6 months, p = 0.07). Patients with concomitant PIK3CA and KRAS mutations had a similar local reoccurrence rate to patients with PIK3CA mutations only. In multivariate analysis, PIK3A mutation was an independent predictor for the development of local recurrences (HR: 3.4, P =0.017)."	19903786

IKZF1 IKZF1 deletion	2613	Childhood B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia	80146	Prognostic	"This study reports on two pediatric cohorts with B-ALL. In the first cohort of 221 high risk, BCR-ABL1-negative pediatric patients, 55.2% of IKZF1 positive patients had a hematologic relapse, 73.4% of IKZF1 positive patients had any relapse, and 74.6% of IKZF1 positive patients had an event (hematologic relapse, any relapse, a second malignant condition or death) as compared to 14%, 25.2%, and 27.1%, respectively, without an IKZF1 alteration. In a less selected cohort of 258 patients with both standard and high risk disease, with common aneuploidies including BCR-ABL1, 46.3% of IKZF1 positive patients had a hematologic relapse, 48.4% of IKZF1 positive patients had any relapse, and 60.5% of IKZF1 positive patients had an event as compared to 22.5%, 25.6%, and 27.6%, respectively, without an IKZF1 alteration. IKZF1 alteration is defined as a deletion or mutation in the gene. Gene expression profiles were found to be similar to BCR-ABL1 positive B-ALL, even when the BCR-ABL1 translocation was not present. The study concludes that IKZF1 alterations are associated with a very poor outcome in B-ALL."	19129520

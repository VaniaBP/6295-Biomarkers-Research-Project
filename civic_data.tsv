PIK3CA E542K mutation	PIK3CA	NCBI:5290	gene	Colorectal Cancer	DOID:9256			Predictive				Pubmed:26184520	This was a retrospective analysis of genetic markers in 503 metastatic colorectal cancer patients who participated in the CORRECT phase III trial of regorafenib. PIK3CA mutations were identified in the tumors of 84 patients, including 27 with PIK3CA E542K. Authors found a clinical benefit of regorafenib across PIK3CA mutated and wildtype subgroups (progression free survival with regorafenib vs placebo: mutant HR: 0.54, wildtype HR: 0.50, P=0.85). Authors do not provide direct comparison between patients with wildtype and PIK3CA E542K patients. Note that it's unclear how many PIK3CA wildtype patients harbor KRAS mutations, though authors' suggest that regorafenib induces clinical benefit regardless of KRAS or PIK3CA mutation status.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

Of the cell lines tested, six harbored BRAF V600E (and WT KRAS) and three harbored BRAF WT (but mutant KRAS). Of the six BRAF V600E expressing cell lines, four were sensitive to vemurafenib (IC50 ranging between 0.025 and 0.35 uM; HT29, Colo205, Colo741, LS411N). Cell lines expressing the BRAF V600E mutation responded better to vemurafenib treatment than cells wildtype for BRAF as measured by reduced cellular proliferation and inhibition of MET and ERK phosphorylation (none of the three BRAF wt cell lines had IC50s less than 10uM). Authors note that one of the vemurafenib-resistant cell lines harboring BRAF V600E (RKO) harbored a concurrent activating PIK3CA H1047R mutation. Nude, athymic mice with HT29 xenografts treated with vemurafenib experienced substantial tumor inhibition and increased lifespan at every dose tested, though authors found 75 mg/kg twice daily to be optimal (95% tumor growth inhibition, 90% increased lifespan compared to vehicle treated controls).	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

One patient (who harbored BRAF V600E in low copy number) responded, 11 had stable disease, and 18 progressed. Treatments included cetuximab + irinotecan (n=20), cetuximab monotherapy (n=5), cetuximab + FOLFIRI (n=4), and cetuximab + oxaliplatin + 5FU (n=1). Median PFS was 8 weeks (2-32 weeks), median OS was 25 weeks (4-237 weeks), and median number of previous chemotherapy lines was 2 (0-4).

PIK3CA Exon 10 Mutation	PIK3CA	NCBI:5290	gene	Colorectal Cancer	DOID:9256			Prognostic				Pubmed:22357840	This study analyzed tumor and patient characteristics from 1,170 colorectal cancer patients derived from the prospective cohort studies: Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow Up Study. PIK3CA mutations were found in 16% (189/1170) of patients via pyrosequencing of FFPE samples. Of patients with PIK3CA mutated tumors, 58% (109/189) had mutations in exon 10 (listed as exon 9 in the publication, as it was common at the time of its publication to exclude non-coding exon 1). The presence of an exon 10 mutation was not significantly associated with differences in colorectal cancer-specific or overall survival when compared to patients with wt PIK3CA (multivariate, stage-stratified HR = 1.15 vs 1). Authors note that they had limited data on cancer treatment data, but assume that treatment regimens did not differ substantially based on PIK3CA mutation status given that patients were diagnosed prior to clinical availability of PIK3CA genotype data. They further note that treatment decisions were typically based on cancer stage, for which their analyses adjusted.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

In response, tumors may accumulate an additional 'gatekeeper' mutation in EGFR, T790M. Authors show that T790M retain low affinity for gefitinib and that introduction of T790M in the presence of L858R mutant increases the ATP affinity of L858R and activates wild-type EGFR, thus showing that increased ATP affinity is the primary mode of resistance in tumors with T790M, though irreversible ATP inhibitors (ie.

FOXP3 expression was found in 405 tumor samples and associated with improved OS in patients treated with anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy (6 cycles of 'FEC100' aka epirubicin + cyclophosphamide + 5-fluorouracil) but not in patients treated with sequential anthracycline->taxane (3 cycles of FEC100 followed by 3 cycles of docetaxel). In-vitro experiments confirmed that FOXP3 expression enhance anthracycline efficacy. The in vitro data consisted of testing the sensitivity of various breast cancer cell lines to anthracyclines after treatment with valproic acid (which increases FOXP3 expression). The authors observed that, while valproic acid has no intrinsic cytotoxic effect on tumor cells, it enhanced the cytotoxic effect of epirubicin specifically in cell lines where FOXP3 expression was increased.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

Recruitment was stopped prematurely when it was deemed unlikely that the increased PFS would be seen in the afatinib group. Median PFS was 5.5 months in the afatinib group and 5.6 months in the trastuzumab group.  Afatanib plus vinorelbine was less well tolerated than trastuzumab plus vinorelbine, and the authors conclude that trastuzumab remains the best choice for treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 positive metastatic BC.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
ERBB2 Amplification	ERBB2	NCBI:2064	gene	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	DOID:60079			Predictive				Pubmed:25370464	Trastuzumab resistance is thought to consist of multiple compensatory mechanisms involving ErbB family members such as increased signaling through ErbB family heterodimers.  The irreversible TKI afatinib blocks EGFR, HER2, ErbB3 and ErbB4.  Thus afatinib was studied in this Phase I trial of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 positive metastatic BC (MBC) in combination with continued trastuzumab treatment, where trastuzumab is still the perferred treatment for trastuzumab-progressed MBC.  Objective response and disease control rates were 11% and 39%.  The authors conclude that the clinical activity observed in this trial warrants further work with afatinib and trastuzumab combination therapy.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

PTTG1 OVEREXPRESSION	PTTG1	NCBI:9232	gene	Meningioma	DOID:3565			Prognostic				Pubmed:26894859	144 cases (discovery set: N=62 discovery; independent validation set: N = 82) of meningiomas were analyzed for transcriptional features defining aggressive clinical course (recurrent, malignantly progressing, or WHO grade III). Meningiomas were categorized into non-recurrent (NR), recurrent (R), and tumors undergoing malignant progression (M). Unsupervised transcriptomic analysis in 62 meningiomas revealed a large set of differentially expressed genes in aggressive subgroups (R+M tumors and WHO grade III, n=332; p<0.01, FC>1.25). Multivariate analysis identified PTTG1 and LEPR mRNA expression independent of gender, WHO grade and extent of resection. The patient group with the longest progression free survival was characterized by co-occurrence of low PTTG1 and high LEPR mRNA expression. IHC in 36 tumors validated these results at the protein level.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

Multivariate Cox regression indicated that shorter survival was associated with higher HER2 expression, and not with age or ethnicity, and that observed differences in survival rates between ethnicities can be ascribed to higher rates of HER2 overexpression in African American patients.  The authors conclude that high HER2 expression in USPC is associated with poor outcome and explains observed differences in outcome between ethnicities.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
ERBB2 Amplification	ERBB2	NCBI:2064	gene	Endometrial Serous Adenocarcinoma	DOID:5750			Predictive				Pubmed:18555254	HER2 expression in uterine serous papillary carcinoma (USPC) is thought to be associated with poor prognosis and may act as a targetable driver mutation in this cancer.  HER2 overexpression in USPC is more common in African American women.  This report covered 2 African American patients, the first of which presented high-grade endometrial adenocarcinoma with IHC3+ HER2-positivity as well as positivity by FISH.  Prior treatment involved surgery and chemotherapy.  Treatment with pacitaxel/carboplatin with trastuzumab showed clear clinical improvement assessed by CT scan and drop in CA-125 levels from 988 to 7.9 U/mL.  The second patient had USPC, and was treated with surgery and radiation.  Trastuzumab monotheraby was then administered.  After 7 months of treatment, the patient showed no sign of disease progression and CA-125 had dropped from 144 to 41 U/mL.  The investigators conclude there is promise in trastuzumab-based therapies in advanced endometrial cancers, including USPC.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
ERBB2 Amplification	ERBB2	NCBI:2064	gene	Endometrial Cancer	DOID:1380			Predictive				Pubmed:19840887	This phase II single arm study assessed trastuzumab monotherapy in HER2 positive endometrial cancers with tumor response as primary endpoint.  Participants had stage III, IV or recurrent HER2 positive endometrial cancer.  During the trial's initial phase, 23 of 132 patients screened met the criteria of IHC2+ or 3+ or FISH positivity for HER2 status.  In the absence of results, the trial entered phase B, where only patients with HER2 amplification by FISH were admitted.  The trial ended early due to poor accrual with 11 of 154 screened meeting the phase B criteria. No major objective tumor responses were observed in the study.  28% of the cancers were of the serous type that had shown trastuzumab response in case studies.  The investigators note that in other HER2 cancers, such as breast and gastrointestinal, trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy has been found most effective, and could warrant more study.  Currently a clinical trial (NCT01367002) is evaluating carboplatin/paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab in uterine serous cancer.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

NPM1 EXON 12 MUTATION	NPM1	NCBI:4869	gene	Acute Myeloid Leukemia	DOID:9119			Prognostic				Pubmed:26789727	Peripheral blood from NPM1 mutated AMLs was assessed for NPM1 mutation status at multiple time points using RT-qPCR with primers designed to amplify different mutant NPM1 transcripts. The test development cohort consisted of 194 cases and an independent validation cohort consisted of 91 cases. Persistence of NPM1-mutated transcripts in blood was present in 15% of the patients after the second chemotherapy cycle. This persistence was associated with a greater risk of relapse after 3 years of follow-up than was an absence of such transcripts (82% vs. 30%; hazard ratio, 4.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.95 to 7.80; P<0.001) and a lower rate of survival (24% vs. 75%; hazard ratio for death, 4.38; 95% CI, 2.57 to 7.47; P<0.001). The presence of minimal residual disease was the only independent prognostic factor for death in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 4.84; 95% CI, 2.57 to 9.15; P<0.001). On sequential monitoring of minimal residual disease, relapse was reliably predicted by a rising level of NPM1-mutated transcripts.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
CEBPA N-TERMINAL FRAME SHIFT	CEBPA	NCBI:1050	gene	Acute Myeloid Leukemia	DOID:9119			Predictive				Pubmed:26167872	This preclinical study establishes that the p30 isoform of CEBPA expressed as a result of N-terminal truncating mutations preferentially interacts with WRD5, a component of the SET/MLL complex. Knockdown of WRD5 in 32D cells (mouse hematopoietic cell line) or transplanted primary mouse bone marrow expressing the p30 isoform restored myeloid differentiation in these cells. OICR-9429, a small molecule inhibitor of WRD5, and anti-WRD5 siRNAs selectively inhibited colony formation of mouse fetal liver cells homozygous for N-terminal CEBPA mutations but not wildtype colony formation. Finally, OICR-9429 reduced viability of primary human AML blasts harboring N-terminal domain CEBPA mutations in culture but not AML blasts with other mutations. Taken together, WRD5 inhibition is a potential therapeutic method for patients harboring N-terminal CEBPA mutations.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

KRAS Mutation	KRAS	NCBI:3845	gene	Cancer	DOID:162			Predictive				Pubmed:23934108	Preclinical study analyzing the differential response to MEK Inhibitors in KRAS and BRAF mutant cancer cell lines and mouse xenografts. Efficacy of MEK inhibitors (GDC-0623 and G-573) in KRAS-driven tumours is mediated by a hydrogen-bond interaction with S212 in MEK that is critical for blocking MEK feedback phosphorylation by wild-type RAF. This mechanism was distinct from GDC-0973 which is less potent in KRAS mutant tumors. Overall, this work indicates that MEK inhibitors with this mechanism of action will be most effective in patients with both BRAF and KRAS mutations.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

Inhibition of active, phosphorylated MEK by GDC-0973 (cobimetinib) is required for strong inhibition of the MAPK pathway in BRAF-mutant tumours. This study provides mechanistic rationale for improved efficacy of cobimetinib in BRAF-mutant models compared to MEK inhibitors acting through an alternative mechanism (GDC-0623 and G-573).	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

Results from a mass spectrometry-based assay to evaluate KRAS activity suggests that G12C mutant KRAS is in a “hyperexcitable” rather than a “statically active” state. ARS-853 targets the inactive state and inhibited proliferation in a subset  (3/11) of KRAS G12C mutant cell lines in 2-D growth assays and 11/11 cell lines in soft-agar colony formation and 3-D assays. This effect was specific for KRAS G12C as 12/12 cell lines with other KRAS mutations (including other G12 mutations V, D and A) were not inhibited in either soft-agar assay.  Relative resistance to ARS-853 developed after epidermal growth factor (50 ng/mL) administration and the combination of erlotinib or afatinib (EGFR-inhibitors) with ARS-853 greatly potentiated growth arrest, apoptosis and decrease of PI3K and MAPK-signaling over single-agent ARS-853 treatment, even in the presence of added EGF.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

Overall response rate was 57%, with 46 partial responses and one complete response. Since crizotinib inhibits MET, 33 patients with available tissue were screened for MET amplification and were found negative, further indicating that patient response was due to ALK inhibition. 31 patients were tested via RT-PCR for known EML4-ALK fusions, and 13 were shown to have EML4-ALK variant 1, four cases had variant 3, and one instance of variants 2, 3b and 5 were seen. 9 were unidentified, suggesting other fusion partners in these instances.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
ALK EML4::ALK mutation	ALK	NCBI:238	gene	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	DOID:3908			Predictive				Pubmed:17625570	A retroviral cDNA expression library was constructed using a lung adenocarcinoma specimen from a 67 year old NSCLC patient, and transfected into mouse 3T3 fibroblasts which were assessed for transformed foci.  Analysis of clones from one transformed focus yielded a novel fusion. This fusion generated a protein with N-terminal consisting of EML4 exons 1-13 and C-terminal consisting of ALK exons 20-29, which comprise the intracellular kinase domain of ALK. In subsequent experiments using EML4-ALK or altered versions, the transforming potential of EML4-ALK was found to be dependent on a functional ALK kinase activity as well as the EML4 basic domain, which was shown to have an important role in EML4-ALK dimer formation.  BA/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK were able to grow independently of IL3 addition, but addition of ALK inhibitor WHI-P154 induced cell death and inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of EML4-ALK. These results indicated that EML4-ALK may be a driver mutation in NSCLC,  and a target for ALK inhibitor treatment.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

This was called variant 5. Two versions of this variant were seen: 5a consisted of EML4 exon 2 fused to ALK exon 20 while 5b contained a 117bp intronic ALK region between the two exons. Genomic PCR showed that EML4-ALK variant 5 tumor cells contained a single EML4-ALK fusion, suggesting 5a and 5b arise from alternate splicing.  5a and 5b showed in-vitro kinase activity and transformed 3T3 cells in cell culture. 5a and 5b transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors when injected in 8/8 nude mice, but 3T3 transformed with ALK alone did not.

Genomic PCR resolved a single breakpoint, but 2 variants of the fusion were observed in cells. Variant 3a consisted of fusion at EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20, while variant 3b fused a 33 bp intronic EML4 region between EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20.  3a and 3b showed strong in-vitro kinase activity, transformed mouse 3T3 cells, and 3b-transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors in 8/8 nude mice.  The ALK inhibitor 2,4-pyrimidinediamine inhibited growth of the 3a/b containing NCI-H2228 NSCLC cell line.

While all constructs rendered Ba/F3 cells IL3-independant, marked differences in sensitivity to ALK inhibitors TAE684 and crizotinib were observed, where v2 was most sensitized to growth inhibition and v3a the least, with v1 and v3b intermediate.  While phospho-ALK western blots indicated that the ALK inhibitors acted similarly on both v2 and v3a EML4-ALK variants, blots of cyclohexamide-treated cells showed that v2 had a shorter half-life than 3a in the transduced cells, potentially explaining increased v2 sensitivity.  Assays with a panel of mutated EML4-ALK variants of varied length suggested that longer EML4-ALK variants are less stable in cells, although this tendency was not observed across other types of ALK fusion.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

Analysis of only KRAS exon 2 hotspot mutations showed that patients with more than 1% mutant allele fraction (n = 19/83) had a hazard ratio of 3.43 for PFS (95% CI, 1.67–7.02; P=0.002) and 2.72 for OS (95% CI, 1.52–4.88; P=0.002) compared to wild-type patients or patients with less than 1% mutant allele fraction. Considering all RAS and BRAF mutations, the patients with more than 1% mutant allele fraction (n = 37/65) had a hazard ratio of 4.52 for PFS (95% CI, 2.25–9.07; P<0.001) and 2.5 for OS (95% CI, 1.57–4.02; P<0.001). ROC analysis showed that a cut-off of 1% for any mutated allele offered the best predictive value.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
TP53 P47S mutation	TP53	NCBI:7157	gene	Cancer	DOID:162			Predictive				Pubmed:27034505	The P47S (rs1800371) variant of TP53 is observed in 1.5% in African Americans and between 6% and 8% in certain African populations but has not been detected in Caucasian Americans. This paper reports functional studies of this variant. Mouse models with this variant show an increase in spontaneous tumor formation. 16 out of 20 (80%) of S47 homozygous mice developed cancer between 12 and 18 months of age. Cancers predominantly included hepatocellular carcinoma, B-cell lymphoma, and histiocytic sarcoma, as well as other tumor types. In S47/wild-type heterozygote mice an increased cancer incidence, with a predisposition for hepatocellular carcinoma, was also found. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human lymphoblastoid cell lines with S47 mutations were significantly less sensitive to cisplatinum treatment compared to TP53 wild-type cells (apoptosis and viability).	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

FGFR1 was also highly expressed in Ewing sarcoma (mRNA and IHC) and correlated with copy number. Retroviral transduction of FGFR1 wild-type or the FGFR1 N546K mutant into NIH3T3 cells led to enhanced proliferation especially for cells harboring the FGFR1 mutation. ShRNA mediated knockdown of FGFR1 inhibited growth of Ewing sarcoma and other cancer cells (A549 lung carcinoma cell line or leukemia cell lines HL60 and Kasumi) with almost complete growth suppression only in the Ewing sarcoma cell lines and knockdown of FGFR1 abrogated growth of cell lines in xenograft.

In a retrospective study of 38 patients with ALK-rearranged DLBCL, 3 were CD20 positive. Only one showed cytoplasmic, nuclear and nucleolar staining associated with NPM-ALK, while the others showed granular cytoplasmic ALK stain characteristic for CLTC-ALK.  Seven molecularly characterized cases were positive for CLTC-ALK.  6/7 patients were treated with CHOP chemotherapy with survival of 5, 10, 26 and 27 months, and two alive at end of study, and one CD20 positive patient was treated with CHOP chemotherapy supplemented with CD20-targeted rituximab, with survival of 8 months, resulting in median survival of 26 months for this group.  Although these numbers are not sufficient for statistical comparison, they compare unfavorably to 3.1 year overall survival and 45% 5 year survival of CHOP treated DLBCL patients, and even less favorably to R-CHOP standard of care for CD20 positive DLBCL, suggesting poor prognosis for CLTC-ALK DLBCL and need for updated treatment in this cohort.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
ALK Fusion	ALK	NCBI:238	gene	Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma	DOID:50745			Predictive				Pubmed:24330038	A 27 year old female patient with advanced-stage IV, CD20 negative diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). ALK rearrangement was determined by FISH, but the ALK fusion partner was not determined due to limited tissue. The patient underwent treatment with CHOP chemotherapy regimen and radiation but did not respond. The patient progressed following salvage chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant. Crizotinib was then administered at 250 mg twice daily, and LDH levels rapidly dropped along with disappearance of palpable lymphadenopathy, but progression ensued after 21 days and the patient died soon after. The authors attribute the short response to crizotinib to the possibility of this tumor having an ALK fusion variant less responsive to ALK inhibition and to a high Ki-67 index in the patient, and deem that despite the brief response, crizotinib shows promise in ALK rearranged DLBCL.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

Histopathological analysis showed diffuse tumor cell infiltrate (CD20/EMA negative) with cytoplasmic ALK. RT-PCR indicated CLTC-ALK fusion. The patient was diagnosed with splenic ALK + diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Stage III, Group A with an IPI of 3. CHOP-21 chemotherapy regimen was administered with improvement in abdominal lymph nodes but worsening in retroperitoneal lymph nodes assessed via standardized uptake values. Subsequent ICE chemotherapy regiment relieved some symptoms prompting the patient to refuse further treatment despite other indications of disease progression. Therapy was reinstated after worsening of disease. GEMOX chemotherapy was administered with dexamethasone and 250mg crizotinib twice daily resulting in symptom relief, decreased lymphadenopathy and LDH decline. The disease then progressed and the patient died 2 months after crizotinib initiation. The authors conclude that partial response to crizotinib was observed and that in future trials ALK rearranged DLBCL patients might see increased benefit with earlier application of targeted therapy during the treatment course.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

ALK I1171 mutation	ALK	NCBI:238	gene	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	DOID:3908			Predictive				Pubmed:25228534	The I1171T mutation in ALK fusions was found in a NSCLC patient shown positive for ALK rearrangement via break apart FISH assay, who progressed after 8 months of crizotinib, and then progressed again after 4 months of alectinib. The MGH056-1 cell line was derived from this patient, and this cell line was resistant to alectinib. Sequencing of MGH056-1 cells revealed the I1171T mutation in ALK. In cell culture studies Ba/F3 cells with EML4-ALK I1171T required more that 10x the concentration of alectinib to significantly reduce viability that was required for EML4-ALK wild-type expressing cells. Computer simulation studies indicated that the I1171T mutation interfered with alectinib binding at the ALK active site.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
ALK I1171 mutation	ALK	NCBI:238	gene	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	DOID:3908			Predictive				Pubmed:25228534	The MGH056-1 cell line was derived from an NSCLC patient with ALK-rearrangement who had progressed on crizotinib and then on alectinib. the cell line was also resistant to crizotinib and alectinib, and sequencing of ALK from the cell line revealed the I1171T mutation. Further testing of this mutation in BaF3 cells revealed that cells expressing EML4-ALk with I1171T mutation required 10x higher concentration to induce cell death than BaF3 cells with wild-type EML4-ALK. In contrast, ceritinib caused loss of viability in EML4-ALK wild-type and I1171T BaF3 cells at comparable concentrations. Ceritinib was also effective at killing MGH056-1 cells that were resistant to alectinib, and reduced Akt and ERK phosphorylation in these cells. Finally, administration of ceritinib to the crizotinib and alectinib resistant patient let to tumor regression and partial response lasting 7 months.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

Ectopic expression of EML4-ALK I1171T in Ba/F3 cells made these cells moderately resistant to crizotinib and resistant to alectinib. In contrast, the frequently used tool compound TAE684 was equally effective against EML4-ALK wild-type and I1171T, causing cell death at 1000x lower concentration then in unaltered Ba/F3 cells supplemented with IL3.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

Increased apoptosis in tumors was seen in dual treatment conditions with increased TUNEL-positive cells. In vehicle treated mice, area of colon covered by tumor increased, while treatment with single agent inhibitors caused growth inhibition resulting in no change in colon area covered by tumors.

MET Overexpression	MET	NCBI:4233	gene	Skin Melanoma	DOID:8923			Predictive				Pubmed:26359985	Whole exome sequencing, transcriptome and methylome alterations in 48 melanoma samples with acquired resistance to BRAFi +/- MEKi therapy compared to patient-matched baseline melanoma tissues were analyzed. 39% of resistant melanomas were not accounted for by any validated mutational mechanism. c-MET was overexpressed in 21 of 48 (44%) resistant samples. Methylome analysis revealed three CpG clusters (C1–3) with differential methylation to be negatively correlated with differential c-MET mRNA expression. In nearly all (90%) pairwise comparisons of tumors and cell lines, differential c-MET mRNA expression could be accounted for by at least one differential CpG cluster methylation (Δβ ≥ 10% and FDR adjusted p ≤ 0.05). In contrast, only 48% displayed a concordant differential expression pattern of at least one c-MET transcription factor. In an independent study, c-MET was overexpressed in 8 of 35 (23%) MAPKi-resistant tumors from 7 of 26 (27%) patients.

In total only 4 out of 450 tumor and cell line samples had concomitant loss of both genes (p=4.9x10^-7). Cell lines (n=5) with FBXW7 mutations or deletions were significantly sensitive to rapamycin and downregulation of FBXW7 (shRNA) increased the sensitivity to rapamycin. In summary, this evidence suggests that FBXW7 may be a biomarker for cancers sensitivity to inhibitors of the mTOR pathway.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

SOX10 Loss	SOX10	NCBI:0	gene	Melanoma	DOID:1909			Predictive				Pubmed:24670642	FACS-assisted shRNA genetic screen identified SOX10 as a determinant of vemurafenib resistance. Suppression of SOX10 in melanoma cells confers resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors through activation of TGF-β signalling and upregulation of EGFR and PDGFRB. EGFR expression or exposure to TGF-β becomes beneficial for proliferation of melanoma cells in the presence of BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Melanoma cells with low SOX10 and consequently high EGFR expression are enriched in the presence of vemurafenib. This study finds evidence for SOX10 loss (N=2) and/or activation of TGF-β signalling (N=2) in 4 of the 6 EGFR-positive drug-resistant melanoma patient samples.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

In a cohort of 229 NSCLC patients that underwent molecular testing, one was found to have a BRAF G596C mutation. This mutation had low kinase activity and reduced MEK/ERK activation compared to wtBRAF in transiently transfected HEK293T cells. Elevated MEK/ERK activation was seen when BRAF G596C was expressed in the presence of CRAF, and this activity was inhibited by both Dabrafenib and Trametinib. A lung epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) expressing BRAF G596C showed reduced ERK activation when treated with combination Dabrafenib and Trametinib.

The t(12;16)(q13;p11) translocation was suggested to aid in the diagnosis of myxoid liposarcoma and is now know to correspond to the FUS::DDIT3 fusion.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

MDA-MB-361 is a HER2 amplified breast cancer cell line harboring PIK3CA E545K, and it had an IC50 of 0.14uM. To asses the effect of pictilisib on cell cycle progression and apoptosis, fluorescence based cell cycle and flow cytometry were used to measure the proportion of cells in various phases and the relative presence of Annexin V, a marker of apoptosis. Untreated, 68% of cells were in G1 or sub-G1. Following treatment with 1.0uM pictilisib, the proportion of cells in G1 or sub-G1 rose to 78%, and the amount of Annexin V detected rose 3 fold. A substantial reduction in phosphorylated AKT (S473) was also noted.

PIK3CA H1047R mutation	PIK3CA	NCBI:5290	gene	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	DOID:60079			Predictive				Pubmed:26920887	As part of a pre-clinical experiment, the efficacy of ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) was compared to that of trastuzumab against various HER2 positive cell lines. HCC1954 and KPL-4 cell lines expressing PIK3CA H1047R were associated with similar sensitivity to T-DM1 as PIK3CA wild-type cell line SK-BR-3; reduced cell viability was observed at concentrations > 0.01 ug/mL in all three cell lines. Conversely, the cell lines harboring PIK3CA H1047R were resistant to trastuzumab in vitro at all concentrations tested (0-10 ug/mL). Further, treatment with T-DM1 on SCID mice xenografted with KPL-4 (PIK3CA H1047R cells) resulted in inhibition of tumor growth. A single dose of T-DM1 >5mg/kg was sufficient to induce tumor regression >20 days after administration.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

KRAS G12D mutation	KRAS	NCBI:3845	gene	Colorectal Cancer	DOID:9256			Predictive				Pubmed:20619739	This was a retrospective study of 691 cetuximab treated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Of those, 76 patients harbored KRAS G12D, were BRAF, NRAS and PIK3CA wt, and had individual response data. Five patients had partial response, 34 had stable disease, and 37 progressed. Treatments included cetuximab + irinotecan (n=61), cetuximab + FOLFIRI (n=6), cetuximab monotherapy (n=5), cetuximab + oxaliplatin + 5FU (n=2), cetuximab + 5FU (n=1), cetuximab + oxaliplatin + bevacizumab (n=1). Median PFS was 12 weeks (3-169 weeks), median OS was 31 weeks (6-232 weeks), and median number of previous chemotherapy lines was 2 (0-5). Median age was 62 years old (32-86), and there were 43 males and 33 females. Using these data and data from the larger cohort, authors concluded that KRAS mutation was strongly associated with poor response to cetuximab and suggested that mutation status of KRAS is the most informative compared to BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 for predicting cetuximab response.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

NRAS Mutation	NRAS	NCBI:4893	gene	Colorectal Cancer	DOID:9256			Predictive				Pubmed:20619739	This was a retrospective study of 605 patients with metastatic, chemotherapy refractory colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab + chemotherapy. Patients with KRAS wildtype, NRAS assessable tumors, and individual response data (n=301) were genotyped for NRAS mutations. Patients harboring NRAS mutant tumors (n=13) had a significantly lower response rate than did patients with wildtype NRAS (n=289; 1/13 [7.7%] vs 110/289 [77.9%]; p =.013). However, there was no significant difference between patients with mutant or wildtype NRAS in disease control rate, progression free survival, or overall survival. Authors note that their small sample size of patients with NRAS mutant tumors made it difficult to assess the effect of NRAS mutation on survival thus the large confidence intervals. Authors further note that the close relationship between KRAS and NRAS, and the lack of NRAS response to another EGFR inhibitor (panitumumab) support the inclusion of NRAS genotyping prior to cetuximab treatment. Authors suggest screening for mutations in the following gene order: KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA exon 21 (listed as PIK3CA exon 20 in the source).	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

ATM Mutation	ATM	NCBI:472	gene	Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia	DOID:1040			Predictive				Pubmed:23585524	Primary cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients were treated with doxorubicin to induce double-strand (DSB). In this setting, cells harboring rare ATM variants (n=8) had significantly higher viability, measured by mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity, compared to wildtype cells (n=8, p < 0.001) suggesting resistance. A qPCR functional assay showed that samples with rare ATM variants (n= 20) had significantly less p21 expression after treatment with doxorubicin compared to treated wildtype controls (n=31, p < 0.001). Furthermore, there was significantly decreased expression of BBC3, BAX, and GADD45 genes which are downstream of ATM in the DNA damage response. In the above studies, parallel cell cultures were treated with fludarabine generating single-strand breaks, in addition to DSB, and monitored for p21 induction to confirm wildtype p53.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

To confirm wild type p53, parallel cell cultures were treated with fludarabine generating single-strand breaks, in addition to DSB, and monitored for adequate p21 induction. In a patient sample with the R3008C variant of ATM in trans with a wild-type allele, confirmed by sanger sequencing, western blot showed stable ATM expression. Treatment with doxorubicin resulted in a p21 expression level of less than 300% that of untreated wild-type controls.

All four patients' GISTs harbored PDGFRA exon 18 mutatations (one I843_S847delinsM, three D842_H845del). The overall survival was more than 12 months for all four of these patients (mean 40.8 months), which is comparable to patients with WT PDGFRA (49.0months).	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
PDGFRA Mutation	PDGFRA	NCBI:5156	gene	Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor	DOID:9253			Predictive				Pubmed:14645423	This prospective study of 127 patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) examined the relationship between kinase (KIT and PDGFRA) genotype and treatment outcome for patients enrolled in a randomized phase II trial of imatinib (CSTI571B 2222). Six GISTs harbored PDGFRA mutations, three of which were deemed imatinib-sensitive by the authors: 1 DIMH842-845 deletion, one I843 deletion, and one V561D point mutation. Two of these patients' GISTs experienced partial responses to imatinib and one experienced progressive disease. Overall, the partial response rate of patients with an imatinib sensitive mutation of KIT or PDGFRA was 75.7% (87 of 115 patients), whereas the partial response rate in patients with no kinase mutation or a previously described imatinib resistant mutation was 0% (0 of 12 patients). The authors concluded that PDGFRA gain-of-function mutations may account for imatinib sensivity in some WT KIT GISTs.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

Out of 40 BRCA (BRCA1 or BRCA2) mutant patients, 5 had somatic BRCA2 mutation, 4 of which were homozygous mutations and one had unknown zygosity. Confirmed objective response was seen in 80% (4/5) of the somatic BRCA2 mutant subgroup. Authors note that response rate was similar regardless of whether the BRCA mutation was somatic or germline, in BRCA 1 or BRCA 2. In a BRCA wild-type subgroup, with low levels of loss of heterozygosity (LOH), confirmed objective response was observed in 10% (7/70) of the patients.

MGMT Underexpression	MGMT	NCBI:4255	gene	Glioblastoma	DOID:3068			Predictive				Pubmed:17442989	In this study, patients with low MGMT expression, compared with patients with high MGMT expression, had a significantly higher response rate (55% v 7%, respectively; P = .004) and improved PFS (median, 5.5 v 1.9 months, respectively; P = .009) and OS (median, 16 v 5 months, respectively; P = .003). Among patients with MGMT data available for analysis, radiotherapy was started and completed in 91% of patients with low MGMT expression. In contrast, among patients with high MGMT expression, only 64% started radiotherapy, and 43% completed it. These results suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be feasible for inoperable glioblastoma patients expressing low levels of MGMT without compromising subsequent treatment with radiotherapy, whereas patients with high MGMT expression are less likely to respond and more likely to experience progression before or during radiotherapy.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

RET C609Y mutation	RET	NCBI:5979	gene	Thyroid Gland Medullary Carcinoma	DOID:3973			Predisposing				Pubmed:19472011	Study of a family with three generations of history indicating co-segregation of RET C609Y and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A, many of whom exhibited medullary thyroid cancers specifically.  22 individuals in this family were carriers of C609Y. Of these, 9 exhibited medullary thyroid cancers. While the variant is strongly suspected of being pathogenic for these tumors, this variant appears to result in later onset of cancer than some other variants and the authors recommend delaying prophylactic thyroidectomy until 10-15 years of age. In addition to this large family, the authors also provide an extensive review of prior reports of C609 variants, identifying a total of 111 patients from 19 publications, representing 21 affected kindreds and 15 sporadic cases. 89 of these cases had C609Y specifically.  The authors also summarize prior functional work that suggests that C609Y has transforming activity that is significant but not as strong as some other variants. Based on all of this analysis, the authors conclude that C609Y causes medullary thyroid cancers but a milder form than some other variants. Based on this paper, the following ACMG evidence codes seem potentially valid: 'PS1', 'PS3',  'PM5', 'PP1', 'PP4', and 'PP5'.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

AKT1 E17K mutation	AKT1	NCBI:207	gene	Cancer	DOID:162			Predictive				Pubmed:28489509	AKT1 E17K mutations are oncogenic and occur in many cancers at a low prevalence. We performed a multihistology basket study of AZD5363. 58 patients with advanced solid tumors were treated. In patients with AKT1 E17K-mutant tumors (n = 52) and a median of 5 lines of prior therapy, the median PFS was 5.5 months , 6.6 months and 4.2 months in patients with ER+ breast, gynecologic, and other solid tumors, respectively. In an exploratory biomarker analysis, imbalance of the AKT1 E17K-mutant allele, most frequently caused by copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity targeting the wild-type allele, was associated with longer PFS as was the presence of coincident PI3K pathway hotspot mutations. Persistent declines in AKT1 E17K in cfDNA were associated with improved PFS and response.

PIK3CA mutations were found in 16% (189/1170) of patients via pyrosequencing of FFPE samples. Of patients with PIK3CA mutations, 39% (73/189) had mutations in exon 21 (listed as exon 20 in the publication, as it was common at the time of its publication to exclude non-coding exon 1). The presence of an exon 21 mutation was not significantly associated with colorectal cancer-specific or overall survival when compared to patients with wt PIK3CA (multivariate, stage-stratified HR = 1.11 vs 1). Authors note that they had limited data on cancer treatment data, but assume that treatment regimens did not differ substantially based on PIK3CA mutation status given that patients were diagnosed prior to clinical availability of PIK3CA genotype data. They further note that treatment decisions were typically based on cancer stage, for which their analyses adjusted.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

Patients with KRAS wildtype, PIK3CA assessable tumors, and individual response data (n=339) were genotyped for PIK3CA mutations. Patients harboring PIK3CA mutant tumors (n=34) had a significantly lower response rate than did patients with wildtype PIK3CA (6/34 [17.7%] vs 115/305 [37.7%]; p =.015). Patients with mutant PIK3CA also experienced lower disease control rate in response to cetuximab treatment. However, there was no significant difference between patients with mutant or wildtype PIK3CA in progression free or overall survival (median PFS: 18 vs 24 weeks; median OS: 39 vs 51 weeks). Authors suggest that PIK3CA exon 21 mutations are more relevant to cetuximab response than PIK3CA mutations as a whole, as PIK3CA exon 10 mutations do not appear to effect cetuximab response (exons are listed as exon 20 and exon 9 in the source).	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

EGFR L858R mutation	EGFR	NCBI:1956	gene	Cancer	DOID:162			Predictive				Pubmed:17877814	MCF-7 cells were transduced with YFP tagged EGFR with E746_A750delELREA mutation, or YFP EGFR wildtype, and stained for ectopic YFP EGFR and phospho-Akt as a readout for EGFR pathway activity. Increased p-Akt stain was seen with ectopic mutant EGFR over wildtype cells. Parallel erlotinib incubations of cells with wildtype EGFR induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien only at high concentration (10uM). Addition of erlotinib to mutant EGFR cell incubations reduced p-Akt signal and induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien at considerably lower conecntration (100 nM) erlotinib.

In four families, three different coding sequence substitutions causing a 15 amino-acid extension from the original stop codon of the VHL gene were described. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes using standard procedures. Sequence analysis consisted of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and automated fluorescence sequencing of all three VHL exons. Patient 1 (family 1), female, presented with a pheochromocytoma at age 11, a pheochromocytoma at age 20, bilateral retinal hemangioblastoma at age 20, and a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor at age 20. She had a family history of early onset pheochromocytoma. She was found to have a substitution mutation in the VHL gene causing a loss of the stop codon, and an extension of 14 amino acids on the C-terminal end of the protein (c.641G>T (p.*241Lext*14). This mutation is noted as p.*241Lext*15 in the paper due to a difference in nomenclature.) Her mother was found to have the same mutation. Her mother had two pheochromocytomas at age 12, and was found to have bilateral retinal hemangioblastomas at age 40. Her brother was found to have a pheochromocytoma at age 13, but was not sequenced. Her maternal gradnfather was noted to have had liver cancer at 72, her great grandfather had unpecified cancer, and her great aunt had Hodgkin's lymphoma at age 38.

Of those 28, 14 patients had a low RRM1 expression and 14 had a high RRM1 expression. Only the patients with low RRM1 expression received a significant benefit from gemcitabine (p=0.0010) whereas the benefit for those with a high RRM1 expression was not significantly better (p=0.3309).  The study also tested the role of ERCC1 expression and its correlation to RRM1 expression.

RRM1 Underexpression	RRM1	NCBI:0	gene	Pancreatic Cancer	DOID:1793			Predictive				Pubmed:17131328	In this study, human pancreatic carcinoma cell line MiaPaCa2, which is a gemcitabine-sensitive cell line, was used for the establishment of chemoresistant cells MiaPaCa2-RG. Analysis for identifying genetic alterations relating to gemcitabine resistance revealed that RRM1 was the most upregulated gene with a 4.5 fold expression. RRM1-speciﬁc RNAi transfection significantly reduced the gemcitabine chemoresistance of MiaPaCa2-RG to the same level as that of gemcitabine sensitive MiaPaCa2. Moreover, gemcitabine response of MiaPaCa2 also became more sensitive.  Next, patients with pancreatic cancer were recruited and 18 tissue samples were taken. The patients with a low RRM1 expression had a significantly better outcome after gemcitabine treatment than those patients with high RRM1 expression (P=0.016).	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

ARID1A Underexpression	ARID1A	NCBI:0	gene	Stomach Cancer	DOID:10534			Prognostic				Pubmed:22808142	In this study, real-time quantitative RT-PCR assays were used in 66 pairs of cancerous and matched adjacent normal tissues. In 43 of those pairs, the expression level of ARID1A was significantly lower in the cancerous tissue than in the normal tissue (P=0.0029). This was then again tested using Western Blotting. Consistent with the real-time PCR results, there was a lower expression of ARID1A in 13 of the tumor tissue samples compared to the normal tissue samples (P=0.0015). In an immunohistochemical analysis of 224 tissue blocks, 115 of those had a decreased ARID1A expression. The data conveyed that lower ARID1A expression was correlated with depth of tumor infiltration (P=0.001). Lastly, cell proliferation in regards to ARID1A expression was tested in cell lines. The cells with silenced expression of ARID1A had a much greater growth than those with greater expression of the protein.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
ARID1A Underexpression	ARID1A	NCBI:0	gene	Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma	DOID:4467			Prognostic				Pubmed:25628030	This study included 290 patients with Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma whose tumor tissues were sampled and then analyzed. These samples were then divided according to ARID1A expression after immunohistochemical staining. Of the 290 patients, 213 had a low ARID1A expression and 77 patients had a high expression. Low ARID1A expression was associated with higher nuclear grade (P<0.001), advanced pTNM stage (P=0.013), shorter cancer-specific survival (p=0.001) and progression-free survival (P<0.001). After a multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards, it was found that ARID1A expression levels are an independent predictor of progression-free survival in patients with CCRCC, although no significant correlation was found between the expression levels and cancer-specific survival.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

A clinical presentation of VHL type 2B was noted. Genetic testing was performed on 17 family members. 11 members with the mutation had manifestations, while 6 members with the mutation were asymptomatic. 1 of the asymptomatic individuals belonged to generation 2, while the remaining 5 belonged to the fourth generation, suggesting they may be too young to present manifestations. From the members that had manifestations: 9 had pheochromocytoma (5 bilateral),  1 had lumbar spine hemangioblastoma, 1 had retinal hemangioblastoma, 4 had renal cell carcinoma (2 bilateral), and 3 had pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (1 also had a serous cystadenoma in addition to the neuroendocrine tumour). ACMG evidence codes: 'PP1' because of segregation results, 'PP2' because there is a missense variant in a gene that has a low rate of benign missense variation and in which missense variants are a common mechanism of disease, 'PP4' because the patient's phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.

Most tumors were found to have heterozygous pattern of mutation likely due to contamination of renal cancer tissues with non-tumor cells. Genomic DNA was extracted from tumors, lymphocytes and cell lines using standard phenol/chloroform extraction or salt extraction protocols. Three sets of primers were designed to amplify the entire exons 2 and 3 and the last one third 3'-region of exon 1, the genotyping method used was PCR-SSCP (polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism). A metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma sample (sample 3087) was obtained from a 68 year old male who was known to smoke one pack of cigarettes per day and had intense alcohol drinking habits. In this patient's tumor (sample 3087), a c.551T>C variant (noted in the paper as nucleotide 764) was identified as a somatic mutation, found only in the tumor. The second mutation, a C>G transversion, c.183C>G (p.P61=) (noted in the paper at nucleotide 396) was present in the non-tumor DNA, a germline synonymous mutation.

Osimertinib failed to induce substantial reductions in phosphorylated ERBB2 in NR6 mouse fibroblast cells transduced to co-express ERBB2 L869R and T798I or ERBB2 wt. AZ5104 blocked phosphorylation to a greater extent in the mutant and wildtype cells. MCF10A cells transduced with ERBB2 wt, ERBB2 T798I alone or ERBB2 L869R and T798I co-expressed did not show substantial reductions in phosphorylated ERBB2, AKT, ERK or S6. AZ5104 induced greater reductions. Authors note that AZ5104 is not being developed independently of osimertinib and only 10% of osimertinib is metabolized into AZ5104 in humans.

Disease control rate (defined as complete response + partial response + stable disease) was 91.6 and 83.3 percent for erlotinib and gefitinib, respectively (p=.113). The study was unable to demonstrate statistical noninferiority via the planned end point; however, the lack of statistically significant differences between erlotinib and gefitinib responses, and the milder adverse effects experienced by gefitinib treated patients, led the authors to conclude that gefitinib is a feasible alternative to erlotinib in treating patients with ex19del EGFR positive, advanced lung adenocarcinoma.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

AKT1 Q79K mutation	AKT1	NCBI:207	gene	Melanoma	DOID:1909			Predictive				Pubmed:24265155	In a retrospective study of 44 relapsed melanoma patients with BRAF V600E/K (known BRAF inhibitor sensitizing mutations), AKT1 Q79K was associated with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitor (dabrafenib) monotherapy in one patient. This patient was a 38 year old female with stage IV M1a melanoma who took dabrafenib (35 mg twice daily to 100 mg three times a day). The best overall response was a 100% reduction in the sum of target lesions, and progression free survival lasted 119 days. Prior to dabrafenib monotherapy, this patient's baseline tumor harbored BRAF V600K—no other somatic alterations were noted. Following relapse, the patient gained AKT1 Q79K in one of two disease progressive tumors. Whole exome sequencing and Sanger re-sequencing were used for all tumors. The authors hypothesized that disruptions in the PI3K-PTEN-AKT pathway represent a core mechanism of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitor therapy.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

ABL1 TKD MUTATION	ABL1	NCBI:25	gene	Chronic Myeloid Leukemia	DOID:8552			Predictive				Pubmed:19779040	This is a retrospective study of imatinib-resistant (n = 805) or -intolerant (n = 238), chronic myeloid leukemia (chronic-phase), patients with mutations in the BCR-ABL gene fusion kinase domain from the START-C, START-R, and CA180-034 trials. With dasatinib monotherapy, imatinib-resistant patients with and without ABL1 mutation  had comparable complete hematologic response [CHR= 90% (345/384) vs. 93% (390/421)], major cytogenetic response [MCyR= 56% (211/384) vs. 58% (243/421)], complete cytogenetic response [CCyR= 43% (164/384) vs. 47% (196/421)], and major molecular response [MMR= 31% (115/367) vs. 36% (145/404)]. Of the 63 imatinib-resistant variants observed (see comment), the authors associate T315I, F317L, and V299L with resistance to dasatinib or lower levels of response due to clinical resistance and low in vitro sensitivity. However, F317L does have a high CHR. They suggest considering alternative treatment options for patients with these three variants.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

PIK3CA Mutation	PIK3CA	NCBI:5290	gene	Colorectal Cancer	DOID:9256			Predictive				Pubmed:23094721	This was a retrospective study of 964 colorectal cancer patients who participated in the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Of 964 patients, 803 patients had wildtype PIK3CA (aspirin use: 337/803, no aspirin use: 466/803)  and 161 had mutated PIK3CA (aspirin use: 66/161, no aspirin use: 95/161). This study found that—among patients with mutated PIK3CA cancer— regular use of aspirin following diagnosis was correlated with superior colorectal cancer specific survival (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.06-0.61; P<0.001) and overall survival (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31-0.94; P = 0.01). Conversely, among patients with wild-type PIK3CA, regular use of aspirin after diagnosis was not significantly associated with colorectal cancer–specific survival or overall survival. Among patients with mutated-PIK3CA tumors, 23 of 90 patients who did not use aspirin after diagnosis (26%) died within 5 years after diagnosis, whereas only 2 of 62 regular users of aspirin after diagnosis (3%) died within 5 years after diagnosis (P<0.001). In contrast, among patients with wild-type PIK3CA tumors, the 5-year cumulative colorectal cancer–specific mortality was the same (15%) for users and nonusers of aspirin after diagnosis (P = 0.92). The authors conclude that PIK3CA mutation may predict response to aspirin therapy in patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

This line showed a significant reduction in colony formation (P = 0.0004) and MTT assay, which tests for NADH activity (P < 0.001), with imatinib vs vehicle treatment. There was no significant difference in a lung cancer cell line without a known driver (H2126) nor in an immortalized bronchial epithelial line (Beas-2B) with either drug treatment in colony forming and MTT assays. Additionally, reduction in cell viability upon kinase inhibitor treatment was rescued with tetracycline-induced overexpression of resistant ABL1-T315I (P < 0.001) confirming the genetic dependency of this cell line on ABL1. Moreover, siRNA facilitated depletion of ABL1 expression resulted in significantly increased cytotoxicity (P < 0.004) with no significant change in H2126 or Beas-2B lines for 2/3 siRNAs supporting ABL1 as the primary drug target. Significant tumor reduction was observed in murine NSCLC xenografts of the H1915 cell line treated with imatinib compared to vehicle treatment (P = 0.0016). No change in tumor growth was observed in xenografts of the H650 cell line containing a wildtype ABL1 locus. In both in vitro and in vivo experiments, doxycycline-inducible expression of drug-resistant ABL1-T315I rescued imatinib-mediated inhibitory effects supporting the specificity of drug responses.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

NTRK1 GON4L::NTRK1 mutation	NTRK1	NCBI:4914	gene	Melanoma	DOID:1909			Predictive				Pubmed:29683819	In this study we report that nonspitzoid metastasizing melanomas of adults may also harbor NTRK fusions and that NTRK expression can be immunohistochemically detected in these tumors. Of 751 melanomas analyzed by next-generation sequencing, 4 metastatic melanomas were identified with NTRK fusions, 3 involving NTRK1 (TRIM63, DDR2, and GON4L), 1 involving NTRK2 (TRAF2). All tumors were cytologically characterized by the presence of large epithelioid melanocytes and were immunoreactive with anti-Trk antibody. The NTRK1-GON4L fusion occurred in a 36 yo woman with a nodular melanoma. Her primary tumor was on her back with a metastasis to the duodenum. NRAS Q61L was identified as a co-occurring melanoma driver in this patient. Thus, the presence of an NTRK family fusion in nonspitzoid metastasizing melanomas of adults may provide a therapeutic opportunity for NTRK inhibitors such as larotrectinib in a small subset of patients with metastatic melanoma.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

FGFR3 FGFR3::TACC3 mutation	FGFR3	NCBI:2261	gene	Transitional Cell Carcinoma	DOID:2671			Predictive				Pubmed:29848605	In this one-arm study, 67 patients with metastastic urothelial carcinoma and diverse FGFR3 alterations were treated with pan-FGFR Inhibitor BGJ398. The majority of patients (70.1%) had received two or more prior antineoplastic therapies. An overall response rate of 25.4% was observed and an additional 38.8% of patients had disease stabilization. No clear differences between type of FGFR3 aberration and response could be seen. Four of five patients with FGFR3-TACC3 fusions had response data, with three achieving stable disease and one having a complete response. The authors conclude that BGJ398 appears to have moderate anticancer activity in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma, that response rates and disease control rate exceed outcomes with most agents in this setting, and that enriching for patients with activating FGFR3 mutations together with the high specificity of BGJ398 for FGFR3 likely explains this improved response.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

Over the next years, she experienced recurrence, multiple rounds of chemotherapy and metastasis -- until her case was presented at a virtual multidisciplinary tumor board organized by the Global Cancer Institute which recommended testing for ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. This fusion was confirmed by RNA-seq, targeted DNA and WGS sequencing as well as immunohistochemistry staining with a TRK antibody. The patient was treated with LOXO-101 (larotrectinib) in a single patient use protocol. Within two months, she experienced near complete resolution of a 10.4 × 8.5 cm fungating chest mass with multiple satellite lesions (See Figure 2). The authors note that TERT promoter mutation and a reciprocal inversion including CDKN2A were also identified, but given what is known about LOXO-101 and ETV6-NTRK3, they  infer ETV6-NTRK3 fusion as the primary mitogenic driver in this patient.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

In YFP-luciferase PDX mice from a 16-year-old with Ph-like B-ALL, flow cytometry indicated the absence of leukemic cells in the bone marrow (p<.0001), peripheral blood (p=.0018), and spleen (p=.0001) after 6 weeks of Larotrectinib (n=10) compared to vehicle treated mice (n=10). Treated mice also had lower splenic weight (p<.001) and the absence of leukemia burden in the bone marrow and central nervous system as determined by histopathology. In 2 mice, leukemic burden increased while Larotrectinib was paused from weeks 6-25. Upon the reintroduction of treatment for 4 weeks, leukemic burden was lowered. Conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK CD19-Cre cells isolated from bone marrow and cultured ex vivo were highly sensitive to serial dilutions of Larotrectinib. After 48 hours of Larotrectinib exposure, Ba/F3 cells stably expressing ETV6-NTRK3 demonstrated a response with an IC50 of 17.0nM (viability measured by CellTiter blue). Finally, Larotrectinib was 1000x more potent against 3 human cancer cell lines with an NTRK fusion versus the 76 with other alterations.

JAK2 GOLGA5::JAK2 mutation	JAK2	NCBI:3717	gene	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma, BCR-ABL1–like	DOID:80650			Predictive				Pubmed:29773603	A 10-year-old Caucasian boy with high risk B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia failed induction therapy. The patient had a complex karyotype and microarray revealed a 9p duplication involving JAK2 and deletions of IKZF1, PAX5, and CDKN2A. RNA studies demonstrated a Ph-like ALL expression signature but did not identify the underlying kinase fusion. Research level RNA sequencing identified a GOLGA5-JAK2 fusion which was confirmed by other methods and patient cells were introduced to patient-derived xenograft models that demonstrated a response to ruxolitinib. Therefore, 40mg/m2 ruxolitinib was added to the patient’s multiagent chemotherapy regiment. The treatment was well tolerated and the patient demonstrated significant clinical response by the end of consolidation, though MRD ≥ 0.01% was detected by flow cytometry. The patient received CART therapy and achieved MRD negative remission, then underwent HSCT, and remained in remission with full donor chimerism at 2-months post-HSCT.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

EGFR V441G/D/F mutations were found in 19% (n=8) of patients with EGFR ECD domain III (location of cetuximab and panitumumab binding epitope) mutations. V441D and V441G were more common than V441F. Resistance of V441G to cetuximab was modeled in silico, and authors predicted that it destroys a critical hydrophobic node. In vitro, V441G/D transduced NIH3T3 cells had significantly reduced binding to panitumumab and cetuximab compared to EGFR wt NH3T3 cells (p<0.01 for all comparisons to wt).

TERT Promoter Mutation	TERT	NCBI:7015	gene	Childhood Low-grade Glioma	DOID:80830			Prognostic				Pubmed:29948154	The aim of this Chinese study was to identify prognostic biomarkers for pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGG). Approximately 300 patients were included. Using Sanger sequencing, mutations at TERT promoter (TERTp) regions were identified (C228T: 3/278; C250T: 4/278). The median age of patients with TERTp mutations was 15 years. There were 5 males and 2 females. Six patients had diffuse astrocytoma and one had pilocytic astrocytoma. Tumors were found in the midline of four patients, the hemisphere of two, and the cerebellum of one. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that TERTp mutations were associated with shorter progression-free survival and overall survival [mt (n=6) vs wt (n=205); p<0.0001 for both OS and PFS]. However, the association of TERTp mutations with OS and PFS was no longer statistically significant after adjusting for age, grade, histology, tumor location, and extent of resection in multivariate analysis.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
H3-3A MUTATION	H3-3A	NCBI:0	gene	Childhood Low-grade Glioma	DOID:80830			Prognostic				Pubmed:29948154	Using Sanger sequencing, H3F3A mutations in patients with pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) were identified (K27M: 13/280; G34R: 5/280).

BRAF KIAA1549::BRAF mutation	BRAF	NCBI:673	gene	Childhood Low-grade Glioma	DOID:80830			Predictive				Pubmed:29156677	This preclinical study proposed to use a combination therapy of an MEK inhibitor (e.g. trametinib) and an mTOR inhibitor (e.g. everolimus) for the treatment of pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) with BRAF fusions to evade acquired resistance to MEK targeted therapy. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway was identified as a resistance mechanism to MEKi treatment based on RNASeq and GSEA analysis. Using flank xenograft model, mice were injected with NIH3T3 cells expressing KIAA1549-BRAF fusions and treated daily with trametinib, everolimus either alone or combined with each other (n=~10 for each treatment arm). Combination therapy (Trametinib 1mg/kg+ Everolimus 10mg/kg) resulted in better suppression in tumor growth than single-agent treatment. Similarly, combination treatment strongly reduced colony formation as well as pERK and pS6 levels, showing on target effects.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
BRAF KIAA1549::BRAF mutation	BRAF	NCBI:673	gene	Childhood Low-grade Glioma	DOID:80830			Prognostic				Pubmed:21610142	Hawkins et al. (2011) retrospectively studied 70 consecutive patient with incompletely resected pediatric low-grade astrocytomas (PLGA). KIAA1549-BRAF fusion was identified in 60% of cases in this cohort. Multi-variant analysis suggested that KIAA1549-BRAF fusion was the most significant favorable prognosis factor in incompletely resected PLGA and was independent of location, pathology, and age. Five-year PFS of fusion positive and fusion negative patients were 61% +/- 8% and 18% +/- 8% (P=0.0004), respectively. These results suggested that KIAA1549-BRAF fusion confers a less aggressive clinical phenotype on PLGA and may explain their tendency to growth arrest.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
FGFR1 Internal Duplication	FGFR1	NCBI:2260	gene	Childhood Low-grade Glioma	DOID:80830			Diagnostic				Pubmed:23583981	This GWAS study identified a structural variant of FGFR1. Duplication of the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of FGFR1 was found in 11 of 149 patients (13/151 tumor samples, including 2 recurrent tumors) with pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) and related low-grade glioneuronal tumors (LGGNTs). This alteration resulted in autophosphorylation of FGFR1 and subsequent activation of downstream PI3K and MAPK/ERK pathways. Also, transfection of Tp53-null astrocytes with TDK duplicated FGFR1 and implantation into the brains of nude mice results in high-grade astrocytic tumours with short latency and complete penetrance. Of note, this variant was present in 24% (8 of 34) of grade II diffuse cerebral gliomas.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

The patient received a successful bone marrow transplant and at day 100 showed a complete remission (CR). The patient relapsed 6 months later, and second line therapy was unsuccessful. During this relapse, SNP microarray was performed on the diagnostic sample and identified amplification of 9q34 flanked by the NUP214 and ABL1 genes. Follow-up molecular studies confirmed a NUP214-ABL1 fusion gene. The patient was then started on dasatinib in combination with vincristine and dexamethasone.

The C238Y variant was considered severely deficient as cotransformation with empty vector resulted in poor transactivation of luciferase expression in 4 yeast strains compared to the p53 wildtype control vector (mean residual activity <25% of wildtype control). Cotransformation of C238Y and wildtype vectors led to the hinderance of luciferase expression below 90% compared to wildtype alone in all 4 yeast strains, which based on the authors criteria qualified the C238Y variant as dominant negative.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

PAX5 P80R mutation	PAX5	NCBI:0	gene	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma With PAX5 P80R	DOID:0			Diagnostic				Pubmed:30643249	Integrated genomic analysis was performed for 1,988 childhood and adult B-ALL cases. Forty four cases (2.2%) showed the P80R substitution in the DNA binding domain for the PAX5 transcription factor gene. These cases were characterized by a unique expression profile. In the majority of the cases the mutation was hemizygous or homozygous, owing to deletion of the wild-type PAX5 allele or copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity. In 96% (42 of 44) of cases, the PAK5 P80R was accompanied by RAS and/or JAK-STAT signaling-pathway alterations (such as NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, NF1, IL7R), thereby suggesting cooperativity between deregulated PAX5 activity and kinase signaling.

TP53 R248Q mutation	TP53	NCBI:7157	gene		DOID:0			Functional				Pubmed:31395785	CRISPR-Cas9 editing was used to create five isogenic MOLM13-TP53 AML cell lines with combinations of wild-type, mutant, and null TP53 alleles at the endogenous locus: p53+/+, p53+/-, p53-/-, R248Q/+, and R248Q/-. Cells were treated with and without DNA damaging agent and p53 inducing agent Daunorubicin and western blot used to assess p21 induction. p21 was induced in +/+ and +/-, but not -/-, R248Q/+, and R248Q/- cells. Daunorubicin treatment caused less cell death in +/- than in +/+ cells, but induced significantly less death in -/-, R248Q/+, and R248Q/-, where these three conditions were not statistically different. A similar result was seen with p53 activating agent Nutlin-3a, where p53-/-, R248Q/+, and R248Q/- cells grouped together with equivalent resistance to the agent in comparison to +/+ and +/- cells. The grouping in results of  -/-, R248Q/+, and R248Q/- suggest that R248Q inactivates the wt p53 copy, which does not occur in the +/- condition.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

CTNNB1 mutations (including specific exon 3 mutations T41A, S45F, S45P, and S45C) were found in 106 out of 145 desmoid tumor specimens, and in 86 out of 115 specimens from patients who had undergone complete surgical resection. At a median follow-up of 31 months, the 5-year recurrence free survival rate of patients with the beta-catenin mutated tumors was worse than that of the patients with wild-type tumors (58% vs 74%), however, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.285). Thus, the study shows that there is no statistically significant correlation between the CTNNB1 mutation and the recurrence risk of sporadic desmoid tumors, even though specific exon 3 CTNNB1 mutations are commonly identified in these tumors.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
DPYD EXON 11-19 DELETION	DPYD	NCBI:0	gene	Head And Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma	DOID:5520			Predictive				Pubmed:31871216	A 69 year old patient diagnosed with HNSCC presented with an unresectable neck mass three months after surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy. A biopsy was taken for whole genome and transcriptome analysis and the patient was started on systemic therapy. After showing resistance to the systemic therapy treatment with 5-FU and leucovorin was initiated based on the discovery of a somatic exon 11-19 in frame deletion in DPYD, which was hypothesized to increase sensitivity to 5-FU in the tumour. A dramatic clinical and radiographic response was sustained for 17 weeks, but following a 3 week treatment break a new nodule appeared. This recurrence showed resistance to re-initiation of treatment with capecitabine (oral 5-FU), and analysis of an additional biopsy provided no evidence as to the mechanism of resistance.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

Homozygosity mapping revealed their parents (who also had cancer) had a consanguineous union. Each sibling was homozygous for CHEK2 R474C. The brother also had a son who died of neuroblastoma at 22 months of age. Amino acid R474 is highly conserved (98%) and forms a salt bridge in both the inactive and active CHEK2 homodimer. Modeling reveals R474C likely negatively affects the saltbridge and destabilizes the protein. Calcium phosphate DNA precipitation to overexpress CHEK2 WT or R474C in NIH3T3 cells revealed limited expression of R474C and limited activation through phosphorylation after UV exposure compared to the WT CHEK2 controls.

PDGFRA Overexpression	PDGFRA	NCBI:5156	gene	Rhabdomyosarcoma	DOID:3247			Predictive				Pubmed:19366796	A high-throughput screen of 637 cancer cell lines revealed 2 to be sensitive to the multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sunitinib. The most highly sensitive line was A-204, a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line. A-204 was then compared to a panel of 6 other rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines and was the only one of the 7 with detectable PDGFRA protein (Western) and to demonstrate sensitivity to sunitinib. In A-204, no PDGFRA gene amplification was detected by FISH, but qPCR revealed a an increased PDGFRA mRNA expression. Reduction of PDFGRA expression by shRNA decreased cell number similarly to sunitinib treatment. Additionally, targeting the PDGFRA ligand, PDGFC, with shRNA or antibody decreased cell number similarly to sunitinib treatment.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
PDGFRA BCR::PDGFRA mutation	PDGFRA	NCBI:5156	gene	B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia	DOID:80638			Predictive				Pubmed:12944919	A 47-year-old man was diagnosed with pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. FISH and nested PCR revealed the patient had a t(4;22)(q12;11) translocation that created an in-frame BCR-PDGFRA fusion. The constitutively activating coiled-coil domain and serine/threonine kinase encoded by BCR exon 1 fused with exon 13 of PDGFRA, which retained both tyrosine kinase domains. During initial therapy, intensification, and consolidation, hyperleukocytosis persisted. Based on the presence of the BCR-PDGFRA fusion, single agent imatinib (Glivec) was administered. A complete hematological response was observed within 6 weeks as the presence of t(4;22) in the bone marrow went from a 70% down to 15%. However, the patient had a relapse in the central nervous system. Continued treatment with imatinib along with intrathecal chemotherapy achieved a meningeal remission after 2 weeks. According to the authors, this patient’s response implicates PDGFRA as a clinically actionable imatinib target.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
PDGFB COL1A1::PDGFB mutation	PDGFB	NCBI:0	gene	Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans	DOID:3507			Predictive				Pubmed:29760553	A 37-year-old man presented with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). Post resection, multiple nodular metastases were found in both lungs and the disease progressed following treatments with cytotoxic agents and microwave ablation. Overexpression of PDGFRB was detected by IHC and a COL1A1-PDGFB fusion was detected by RT-PCR. Increased PDGFRB is activated by the COL1A1-PDGFB fusion product, which promotes the overactivation of downstream PDGFRB signaling pathways. Imatinib treatment failed as stable disease was followed by disease spread and progression. The patient was then treated with a daily oral dose of sunitinib (a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor) for 4 consecutive weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period. After 2 months on sunitinib, the patient experienced overall shrinkage of the body’s tumor mass (reduction of tumor in arm and partial response in lung and pancreas metastases). Sunitinib resulted in 9 months of progression free survival and improved quality of life. Ultimately, the disease progressed and the patient died 46 months after diagnosis.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

An initial analysis detected the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion and a NRASGly12Asp mutation. Initial therapies included chemotherapy and CAR-T infusion. Relapse 6 weeks after initial complete response to these therapies found a large increase in fusion transcripts and NTRK3 rearrangements were detectable by FISH in 50/50 blast nuclei whereas NRAS mutations were no longer detectable. The patient was treated with oral monotherapy larotrectinib (100mg twice per day). After 4 days on treatment peripheral blood blasts became undetectable; after 6 days on treatment lymphadenopathy and leukemia cutis resolved and a biopsy revealed an ablated bone marrow with only a few scattered blasts. The patient experienced clinical benefit with no apparent side effects during 42 days of larotrectinib treatment, however, patient eventually succumbed to multifocal angioinvasive aspergillosis because of insufficient recovery of normal hematopoiesis.

Sequencing of these cell lines found no other driver mutations in 265 other cancer genes suggesting the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion is the oncogenic driver.  The IC50 for the IMS-M2 and M0-91 cell lines was 0.47 and 0.65 nmol/L, respectively.  Mouse xenografts treated with entrectinib at 10 or 30 mg/kg had complete remission while treatment with 3 mg/kg caused significant reduction in tumor growth.  Testing of the bone marrow of IMS-M2 xenografts after 3 weeks of treatment found no human CD45-positive cells in the 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg treatment groups; all vehicle treated mice had some human CD45-positive cells in their bone marrow.

One case, a 3-year-old male harbored the in-frame OFD1-JAK2 fusion (exon 22 and exon 13) and had an IZKF1 deletion as determined by MLPA. This patient had a high white blood cell count (185,000/ul) and failed induction along with a poor response to prednisolone. Following stem cell transplant, the patient remained in continuous complete remission.

In this study involving 373 high risk pediatric B-ALL cases of which 29 were kinase-fusion positive patients, only one case with the PAX5-JAK2 fusion was observed. There is pre-clinical and case-study evidence that the presence of JAK2 fusions in B-ALL predicts sensitivity to JAK2 inhibitors; clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate efficacy of adding JAK2 inhibitors to treatment of Ph-like B-ALL cases with JAK2 fusions (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02723994).	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
FLT3 D835Y mutation	FLT3	NCBI:2322	gene	Cancer	DOID:162			Predictive				Pubmed:28516360	Gilteritinib inhibited the cell growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing D835Y (IC50 1.6 nM; 95% CI: 1.1–2.4 nM) compared to controls (IC50 420nM; 95% CI: 350–500 nM). Additionally, immunoblots showed gliteritinib reduced phosphorylation of FLT3 and downstream targets in Ba/F3 D835Y cells in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, in nude mice xenografted with Ba/F3 cells expressing D835Y, gilteritinib showed antitumor efficacy at 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, and induced tumor regression at 30 mg/k. Computational modelling demonstrated that gilteritinib interacts with activated FLT3 at the ATP-binding site, which is distant from the D835 containing activation loop. This inhibitory mechanism allows for kinase inhibition to occur in the face of D835 mutation.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

MYOD1 L122R mutation	MYOD1	NCBI:0	gene	Spindle Cell Rhabdomyosarcoma	DOID:3260			Diagnostic				Pubmed:27562493	This study evaluated forty-nine cases of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) (17 cases of alveolar RMS, 10 of embryonal RMS, 21 of spindle cell and sclerosing RMS, and a single case of a pleomorphic RMS) for MYOD1 (L122R), PIK3CA (H1047), and PIK3CA (E542/E545) variants. All 10 cases that were positive for the MYOD1 (L122R) variant were either the spindle cell (3/12) or the sclerosing (7/9) subtypes of RMS, while all 10 cases of the embryonal subtype of RMS were negative for the MYOD1 (L122R) variant. The study suggests that the MYOD1 L122R variant is specific for spindle cell and sclerosing subtype of RMS (where it was detected in 10/21 cases or 48%). The study also confirmed the positive relationship between the spindle cell and the sclerosing subtypes of RMS, which both can have the same molecular abnormality (MYOD1 L122R variant) and are now considered to be the same subtype. Finally, the study confirmed the negative correlation between the aforementioned subtypes with the embryonal subtype of rhabdomyosarcoma.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

None of the embryonal RMS cases was positive for the MYOD1 L122R variant. All cases were treated with surgical resection and either adjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant radiotherapy, or both. On patient follow-up, the alive-with-disease ratio was higher in the adult than in the pediatric population. Furthermore, the patients positive for MYOD1 mutation showed a higher number of disease-positive states on follow-up, while the patients negative for MYOD1 mutation showed a higher number of disease-free states on follow-up. This suggests that the MYOD1 L122R variant is associated with a more aggressive clinical course, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (P=0.34).	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

There was one case of predominantly spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma with the MYOD-1 mutation that also contained a PIK3CA mutation. The case with both MYOD-1 and PIK3CA mutations consisted histologically of lipoblasts within focally myxoid stroma, thus demonstrating that the PIK3CA mutation was a secondary aberration while MYOD-1 was the primary neomorphic mutation. On clinical follow-up, seven of the MYOD-1 variant cases experienced local recurrences and/or metastatic disease. In a median of a 13.5 month follow-up, there was 1 patient who passed away, 8 patients who were alive with the disease, and 3 patients who were alive without the disease; there was no correlation with the type of treatment that the patients had received. This supports aggressive clinical course for SC/SRMS positive for MYOD-1 variants, regardless of the presence of a concurrent PIK3CA mutation.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

Using cytogenetic and FISH analyses, a novel t(12;15)(p13;q25) rearrangement was identified in CFS cases (3 of 4, including 1 case likely presenting overgrowth of normal fibroblasts). Mapping of breakpoints and mRNA analysis revealed that the translocation gives rise to the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion transcript, consisting of the HLH dimerization domain of ETV6 fused to the kinase domain of NTRK3. This aberration was absent in adult-type fibrosarcoma (ATFS, 2 cases) and infantile fibromatosis (IFB, 15 cases). This is the first study describing the involvement of NTRK proteins in human oncogenesis and ETV6 gene fusion in solid tumors and proposing ETV6-NTRK3 as a diagnostic biomarker for CFS.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

KRAS Mutation	KRAS	NCBI:3845	gene	Ovary Serous Adenocarcinoma	DOID:5744			Predictive				Pubmed:32822286	Post hoc analysis of a randomized phase 3 trial (MILO/ENGOT-ov11) suggests a possible association between KRAS mutation and response to binimetinib in patients with pretreated (1-3 lines of prior chemotherapy) recurrent or persistent Low-Grade Serous Carcinomas of the Ovary, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneum. Of 133 binimetinib-treated patients with individual response and molecular data, 46 harbored KRAS mutations. KRAS mutation status was significantly associated with local best response (P=0.004); 44% of patients with KRAS mutation versus 19% of patients with KRAS WT had CR or PR in the binimetinib arm. KRAS mutation was also associated with prolonged PFS in patients treated with binimetinib (median PFS: KRAS mutant: 17.7 months; KRAS wild-type (WT): 10.8 months; P = .006), but not in patients receiving standard chemotherapy (physicians' choice, median PFS: KRAS mutant: 14.6 months; KRAS WT: 11.5 months; P=.502).	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
KRAS Wildtype	KRAS	NCBI:3845	gene	Colorectal Cancer	DOID:9256			Predictive				Pubmed:26161928	In an in vitro study, a human colon adenocarcinoma SW48 cell line expressing KRAS wildtype did not demonstrate resistance to regorafenib treatment (IC50: 114.28 nM) compared to SW48 cells expressing various common KRAS G12/G13 mutations. Resistance was determined by assessing cell viability. In vivo, SW48 cells were injected into NOD/SCID mice. Treatment with regorafenib did not lead to a significant delay of tumor growth, although KRAS wt mice trended toward better response than KRAS G12C expressing mice. IHC analysis of mouse tissue revealed more pronounced changes in markers of proliferation (Ki67), angiogenesis (CD31), and apoptosis (TUNEL) in KRAS wt mice treated with regorafenib compared to KRAS G12C mice whose tumors did not display changes in these markers. Authors concluded that KRAS wildtype was not resistant to regorafenib compared to other common KRAS G12/G13 mutations.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
BCL2 G101V mutation	BCL2	NCBI:596	gene	Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia	DOID:1040			Predictive				Pubmed:31160589	This study described the similar crystal structures of BCL-2 wild-type and G101V when bound to venetoclax. Steady state competition surface plasmon resonance experiments demonstrated a ~177 fold decrease in venetoclax affinity for G101V (Ki=3.2nM) versus WT (Ki=.018nM). Resistance is acquired by a knock-on effect in the P2 pocket of V101 on an adjacent residue, E152 as affinity for venetoclax was restored in BCL2 G101V through the introduction of an E152A mutation (Ki =.002nM). Additionally, BCL2 G101V maintains similar affinity for apoptotic BH3 peptides, which assists in the prevention of apoptosis.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

FGFR3 S249C mutation	FGFR3	NCBI:2261	gene	Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma	DOID:4006			Oncogenic				Pubmed:16338952	In contrast to controls (empty vector and FGFR3 wildtype overexpression NIH-3T3 cell lines), the stable transfection of NIH-3T3 cells with FGFR3b-S249C led to ligand-independent phosphorylation of FGFR3 and the acquisition of elongated, refractile spindle-shaped morphology like transformed cells. Using a thymidine incorporation assay, S249C expressing cells were shown to lose contact inhibition and grew 3x to 4x more rapidly than controls. Soft agar assays demonstrated increased colony formation and anchorage independent growth in S249C expressing cells versus controls. All nude mice subcutaneously injected with S249C cells rapidly formed tumors, but no tumors were observed in empty vector injected mice.

Dimer stability was modestly increased by S249C (-3.7 kcal/mol) versus wildtype FGFR3 (-3.4 kcal/mol). Intrinsic FRET demonstrated S249C dimers were significantly closer together (45 A) than the wildtype dimer (53 A). The substitution of cysteine was expected to lead to strong covalent bonds, but the authors conclude their data demonstrates S249C does not induce constitutive FGFR3 dimerization, but induces dimer structural modifications.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

NTRK3 ETV6::NTRK3 mutation	NTRK3	NCBI:0	gene	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma	DOID:80630			Oncogenic				Pubmed:29880614	The tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK3 was inserted into exon 6 of Etv6 to create conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK3 mice . Expression was induced in pre-b cells during lymphoid development by CD19-Cre. Fusion expression in the bone marrow was confirmed by RT-PCR. Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice developed aggressive lymphoid leukemia. Compared to controls (Etv6-NTRK3/+; n=28), Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice (n=27) displayed worse overall survival (p<.0001), decreased body weight (p<.0001), increased spleen weights (p<.05), and increased circulating CD19+/B220+ cells (p=.0008). Over 60% of Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice demonstrated extramedullary tumors and over 50% presented with central nervous system infiltration. RNA-sequencing indicated upregulation of the AP1 complex in the Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice. The authors conclude this ETV6-NTRK3 Cre-19 mouse model mimics human B-ALL.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

Fifty-four Black patients presenting with phaeochromocytoma between 1980 and 2009 were included. Two patients had VHL syndrome (submitted for publication). The second diagnosis of VHL syndrome was made in the pregnant woman (Case 9) who had bilateral adrenal phaeochromocytomas. There were no clinical features of VHL syndrome; however, MRI showed a haemangioblastoma in the cervical spine. Genetic testing revealed a missense mutation (c.499C>T) in the VHL gene, located on chromosome 3p26-p25. Her 6-year-old daughter screened positive for the mutation; her 8-year-old son was negative. Both mother and daughter will be investigated further and monitored long-term. ACMG PP4	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

CIC CIC::DUX4 mutation	CIC	NCBI:0	gene	CIC-rearranged Sarcoma	DOID:81250			Diagnostic				Pubmed:28346326	This study consists of a cohort of 115 patients with a class of sarcomas that had similar morphology to Ewing sarcoma. The presence of a CIC rearrangement was detected in all the cases by FISH. Previously, it was unclear whether this class of sarcomas should be classified as a separate entity or be classified as a variant of Ewing sarcoma. CIC-rearranged sarcomas showed a male predominance with an average age of 32 years old. A CIC::DUX4 fusion was found by additional FISH testing for DUX4 loci in 57% of the cases, with either a translocation between chromosomes 4 and 19 or between chromosomes 10 and 19. 57 patients were followed clinically and showed a 5-year survival rate of 43%, which was significantly lower than the 77% 5-year survival rate of Ewing sarcoma patients (p=0.002). In histologic evaluation, stromal myxoid change was a common finding in CIC-positive tumors, while this is not usually found in Ewing sarcoma. CIC-positive tumors showed a diffuse CD99 immunohistochemical staining pattern in only 23% of the cases, in contrast to that found in Ewing sarcoma, which showed a diffuse CD99 staining pattern in almost all of the cases. Therefore, this study provides evidence that sarcomas that contain CIC::DUX4 fusion should be considered a separate entity, distinct from Ewing sarcoma.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
BRAF V600E mutation	BRAF	NCBI:673	gene	Thyroid Gland Papillary Carcinoma	DOID:3969			Predictive				Pubmed:27460442	Open label phase 2 (Clinical Level B) trial including patients from across the globe (USA, Italy, and the Netherlands) investigating sensitivity to Vemurafenib in patients that have BRAF V600E-positive papillary thyroid cancer that have become resistant to radioactive iodine (the standard treatment). There were 116 patients identified for this trial, 51 of which met the conditions to be included. These 51 patients were split into two cohorts: 1) patients that had never been treated with a multikinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR and 2) patients that have previously been treated with a VEGFR multikinase inhibitor. In cohort 1, ten of 26 patients had best overall response. Best overall response was defined as the proportion of patients with a complete or partial response, however these ten patients were all partial response. In the same cohort 1, nine had achieved stable disease control for at least six months; therefore, 19 patients achieved disease control (73% of total cohort 1, 95% CI 52-88). In cohort 2, of 23 eligible patients, six had a partial response as best overall response and six had stable disease control for at least six months; therefore, 12 patients achieved disease control. (55% of total cohort 2, 95% CI 32-76). The authors conclude that vemurafenib is a potential treatment option for late-stage BRAF V600E-positive papillary thyroid cancer for treatment in patients naïve to a multikinase inhibitor (Cohort 1) and to patients that have been previously treated with a multikinase inhibitor (Cohort 2).	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

The 9 ETV6-ABL1 positive ALL cases (7 diagnosis and 2 relapse samples) that underwent whole genome expression profiling displayed similar expression profiles to the BCR-ABL1 positive leukemia cohort. Also, 9/10 ETV6-ABL1 BCP-ALL cases were classified by custom Taqman assay (designed to detect BCR-ABL1-like expression signature) as BCR-ABL1-like. The study thus shows that in B-ALL, the presence of the ETV6-ABL1 fusion correlates with the BCR-ABL1 like (Ph-like) subtype of the disease.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
ABL1 NUP214::ABL1 mutation	ABL1	NCBI:25	gene	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma, BCR-ABL1–like	DOID:80650			Diagnostic				Pubmed:22897847	Transcriptome and whole genome sequencing were performed on 15 cases of B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL) that were previously shown to have a BCR-ABL1-like (Ph-like) expression signature. Two cases were positive for the NUP214-ABL1 fusion, identified by RNA-seq analysis. In both cases the fusion was generated by a small copy number gain (duplication) in 9q34, with the breakpoints in the two partner genes. Considering the previously shown Ph-like expression signature in the studied cases, the results suggest association of the NUP214-ABL1 fusion in B-ALL with the Ph-like genetic subtype of the disease.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

FISH using a BCR-ABL1 probe demonstrated 50-80 extrachromosomal copies of ABL1; FISH using probes to the 3' regions of ABL1 and NUP214 confirmed NUP214-ABL1 amplification in ~99% of cells. The NUP214-ABL1 amplification was also confirmed by MLPA and SNP6.0 analysis. Additionally, this patient harbored a focal deletion of IKZF1 (exons 2-7) and CDKN2A/B (exons 1-2). Day 29 marrow showed complete morphological remission; however PCR-based IgVH MRD rearrangement studies revealed clonal IgVH rearrangement (1 in 10^4 cells). Patient underwent sibling donor allogenic stem cell transplant, and at 4 months is in complete remission. NUP214-ABL1 positive patient primary cells were cultured with various tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib). After 72-hour culture there was no significant reduction in viable cell numbers or increase in apoptosis, when compared to the no drug control. The in vitro sensitivity to TKIs may be attributed to variable NUP214-ABL1 copy number and/or focal deletions of IKZF1 and CDKN2A/B.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
ABL1 ZMIZ1::ABL1 mutation	ABL1	NCBI:25	gene	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma	DOID:80630			Oncogenic				Pubmed:18007576	A 18-month-old female with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Chromosome and FISH analysis using a BCR-ABL1 probe confirmed the involvement of ABL1 in a t(9;10)(q34;q22.3) translocation. Follow-up molecular analysis using RT-PCR confirmed the presence of a ZMIZ1-ABL1 fusion transcript (ZMIZ1 exon 14 and ABL1 exon 2). Patient was treated according to standard risk protocol without kinase inhibitors and is in first complete remission. Authors note that The ZMIZ1-ABL1 fusion transcript predicts the the synthesis of ZMIZ1-ABL fusion protein, which contains one of the proline-rich domains of ZMIZ1 and ABL tyrosine kinase domain. Similar to other oncogenic fusion proteins, the proline-rich domain of ZMIZ1 is involved in protein-protein interactions, and therefore the fusion may encode a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that promotes cellular transformation. The authors further note that patients with t(9;10) would be eligible for imatinib treatment.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

ABL1 SFPQ::ABL1 mutation	ABL1	NCBI:25	gene	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma	DOID:80630			Oncogenic				Pubmed:21388681	The authors describe two cases of B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with the t(1;9)(p34;q34) rearrangement, resulting in a fusion between the pre-mRNA processing protein gene SFPQ and the ABL1 kinase gene. Patient 1 was a 19-year old female patient with common B-cell ALL expressing 2 myeloid markers. Due to the presence of the 2 myeloid markers, she was treated with a classic acutemyeloid leukemia (AML) induction regimen (cytarabine and idarubicin), along with imatinib due to the involvement of the ABL1 locus. Patient achieved complete remission, followed by a consolidation regimen with cytarabine and mitoxantrone, a non-familial allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with a dose-reduced conditioning, and a maintenance treatment with dasatinib. Complete remission was maintained 32 months after the allograft. Patient 2 was a 28 year old female, diagnosed with common B-ALL (EGIL B-II), and was included in the GRAALL 2005 protocol with intensified cyclophosphamide administration, and was corticosensitive but chemoresistant (60% blasts at day 8). She achieved complete remission after the induction regimen, and this was followed by consolidation regimen with cytarabine, high-dose methotrexate and cyclophosphamide. After this, familial allograft with her brother as donor was performed, and she remained in complete remission 18 months after allograft. FISH and sequencing have confirmed the fusion between SFPQ-ex9 and ABL-ex4 in both patients. The authors conclude that the t(1;9)(p34;q34), fusing SFPQ in 1p34 with ABL1 in 9q34, represents a recurrent abnormality in B-ALL.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
ABL1 SFPQ::ABL1 mutation	ABL1	NCBI:25	gene	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma	DOID:80630			Predictive				Pubmed:32306475	Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with break-apart probes, the authors screened retrospectively 55 pediatric and 50 adult B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cases negative for common drivers (B-other) for rearrangements involving ABL1, ABL2 and PDGFRB tyrosine kinase genes. Three (6%) of the adult but none of the childhood B-other cases were positive for ABL-class aberrations. One of these adult patients was a 29-year old male with a t(1;9)(p34;q34). RT-PCR and sequencing confirmed that the translocation resulted in a rare SFPQ-ABL1 fusion. The patient was treated with allogenic stem-cell transplant with addition of dasatinib and imatinib, and was in remission at the time of publication (28 months after the diagnosis). A review of 6 previously published cases with SFPQ-ABL1 fusion indicated that exon 9 of SFPQ and exon 4 of ABL1 were consistently involved. The fusion was typically found in adolescents/younger adults without hyperleukocytosis, and IKZF1 deletions were recurrently found. In the cases reported, patients who were not treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation had relapsed, and the authors therefore suggest that TKIs should be added to the therapy of SFPQ-ABL1-positive B-ALL.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

The fusion was confirmed by amplification of the genomic breakpoints and RT-PCR; it was shown to be in-frame and to encode the N-terminal domain of the SFPQ-encoded protein and the entire tyrosine kinase domain and C-terminal sequences of the ABL1 kinase. The SFPQ (Splicing Factor Proline And Glutamine Rich) gene, encoding a protein that specifically binds to intronic polypyrimidine tracts in pre-mRNA and regulates signal-induced alternative splicing, was thus described as a new 5’ partner of the ABL1 gene in B-ALL.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

Two different RCSD1-ABL1 fusion transcripts, presumably resulting from alternative splicing, were identified, one consisting of the first three exons of RCSD1 fused to ABL1 starting from exon 4, the second of the first two exons of RCSD1 fused to exon 4 of ABL1. The patient received a modified CVAD induction therapy. After 2 induction courses, the BM had residual disease with 50% of leukemic blasts. At day 10 from the start of the 3rd induction regimen, dasatinib was introduced at a dose of 140 mg once daily. Two weeks later morphological remission was confirmed, and only minimal residual disease (1.5% of leukemic cells) was detectable by FISH. The first consolidation therapy consisted of dasatinib 140 mg once daily and high-dose methotrexate. BM at four weeks post consolidation showed complete morphological and cytogenetic remission (CCyR). Dasatinib was continued until an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed four months after diagnosis. After transplantation, no TKI therapy was used. At 12 months from HSCT, the patient experienced a cytogenetic relapse and a month later a hematologic relapse. Immunosuppressive drugs were discontinued, and the patient received a re-induction therapy with dasatinib 70 mg twice daily combined with one cycle of high-dose chemotherapy.

Her day 8 peripheral blood minimal residual disease (MRD) testing showed 18–25% blasts and her day 29 bone marrow evaluation revealed induction failure. She continued chemotherapy per the very high-risk control arm of AALL-1131 with the addition of dasatinib due to the RCSD1-ABL1 fusion. Her consolidation course was complicated due to presumed fungal infection and C. difficile colitis, but she was able to complete the consolidation treatment. The last bone marrow done on November 2014 showed no evidence of persistent/recurrent leukemia.

RT-PCR and sequence analyses detected transcription of a single RCSD1-ABL1 fusion gene variant, which had breakpoints in exon 3 of RCSD1 and exon 4 of ABL1. The patient was treated with hyper-CVAD combination without achieving complete remission (CR). Therefore, the patient was treated with combination chemotherapy comprising 800 mg of imatinib for 7 days and 40 mg of dexamethasone for 4 days followed by 140 mg of dasatinib daily. On day 74, lymphoblasts disappeared from the peripheral blood, but 15% remained in the bone marrow. A second course of hyper-CVAD with 140 mg of dasatinib daily was administered. Twenty days after therapy using 1.5 g of methotrexate and cytarabine (total dose; 18 g), lymphoblasts suddenly increased by 82%. Administration of 40 mg of dexamethasone for 4 days was highly effective in reducing lymphoblast count. Administration of triplicated dexamethasone and dasatinib achieved stable disease with partial remission in the bone marrow. However, during the seventh administration of dexamethasone, the disease recurred and there was no further response to treatment.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

The RCSD1-ABL1 t(1;9)(q22;q34) fusion between exon 3 of RCSD1 and exon 4 of ABL1 was identified by RT-PCR. The patient was enrolled on GMALL elderly (01/2003) and treated accordingly with an induction failure. She therefore continued chemotherapy with high-dose methotrexate and asparaginase. Her disease achieved first complete remission in January 2013, and high-dose cytarabine was administered. The patient experienced a BM relapse in April 2013. Re-induction chemotherapy with one cycle of FLAG-Ida comprising fludarabine, cytarabine, GCSF and idarubicin was administered, but BM revealed residual disease with 70% of leukemic blasts in May 2013. The patient was included in the BEZ235 study and treated with an oral PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, but no remission could be achieved. Salvage therapy with single agent dasatinib was initiated at a dose of 100 mg once daily, in July 2013. A stable disease with partial remission in the BM was achieved. Moreover, inhibition of RCSD1-ABL1 activity by dasatinib was shown by Western analysis of phosphorylated ABL1 and its downstream target CRKL. Treatment with dasatinib was complemented with two cycles of chemotherapy, including clofarabine and cyclophosphamide. CR 2 was achieved in October 2013, whereas minimal residual disease (MRD) levels still remained positive. In this regard, treatment with blinatumomab was started within the MT103-203 study in January 2014, and MRD levels became negative. In March 2014, allo-SCT was performed successfully.

This cohort was split into two groups—BRAF+ and BRAF-. Of the 107 patients that were BRAF+, 25% had tumor reoccurrence compared with 9% in the BRAF- group (P=0.004). Multivariate analysis was performed to assess BRAF correlation independent of known contributing factors to cancer such as age, gender, and multifocality. The results showed that the BRAF mutation is indicative/contributes to lymph node metastasis, associated with tumor reoccurrence, stage, and that recurrent disease was more extensive and required more aggressive treatments in BRAF+ patients compared with BRAF- patients. The authors conclude that PTC patients with the BRAF V600E mutation have worse clinicopathological outcomes, and that the BRAF mutation can be used to assess risk stratification in patients with PTC.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
ABL1 ETV6::ABL1 mutation	ABL1	NCBI:25	gene	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma	DOID:80630			Predictive				Pubmed:30028819	A 4-year-old female presented with relapsed B-cell precursor ALL and no MLL or BCR-ABL1 rearrangement per cytogenetic studies. During multiple periods of short remission and relapse she was treated with high risk induction chemotherapy, craniospinal irradiation and matched unrelated donor bone marrow transplant. Finally, WES and RNA-seq were performed on the tumor and normal samples, which identified a cryptic ETV6-ABL1 fusion as well as a biallelic CDKN2A deletion. She was administered imatinib and achieved a morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular remission, which were maintained for 18 months. After a fourth relapse, clinical sequencing was repeated and ultimately identified the persisting ETV6-ABL1 fusion (with no mutation identified in the kinase domain of ABL1) as well as a previously undetected MLL2-ADCY9 fusion resulting in truncation of MLL2 (also known as KMT2D). Treatments of Dasatinib, Ponatinib, and Panobinostat were unsuccessful and the patient ultimately succumbed to her disease 7 year after her initial diagnosis.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
ABL1 SNX2::ABL1 mutation	ABL1	NCBI:25	gene	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma, BCR-ABL1–like	DOID:80650			Diagnostic				Pubmed:27176795	This retrospective study intended to clarify clinical characteristics of patients with B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL) and kinase fusions that are not well described (excluding ETV6-RUNX1, E2A-PBX1, MLL rearrangements and BCR-ABL). The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is rare; in this study investigating 373 high risk pediatric B-ALL patients of which 29 demonstrated uncommon kinase gene fusions, only one case with SNX2-ABL1 (exon 3-exon 4) was observed. Gene expression profiles were compared to Ph-positive B-ALL and reportedly all fusion-containing samples (except P2RY8-CRLF2) were similar to BCR-ABL1-positive patients. This patient did not respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors administered in combination with chemotherapy at the first or second relapses.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

Next generation sequencing (RNAseq, WGS, and/or WES) performed on 154 Ph-like patients revealed 91% possessed genomic alterations activating kinase signaling with 96 (62%) involving rearrangements. In one adolescent male, an in-frame SNX2-ABL1 fusion (exon 3 and exon 4) with the ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain intact was identified and confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger. This patient, evaluated by WES and RNA-seq, also harbored IKZF1, EBF1, and VPREB deletions, and was designated Ph-like non CRLF2.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
ABL1 RANBP2::ABL1 mutation	ABL1	NCBI:25	gene	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma, BCR-ABL1–like	DOID:80650			Predictive				Pubmed:31434701	This retrospective study reported the outcome of 24 patients with Ph-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) harboring ABL-class fusions, who were treated with a combination of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and chemotherapy. Of the 24 patients reported, 12 had fusions involving ABL1; in 7/12 patients the ABL1 fusion was detected at diagnosis, and in 5/12 it was identified at relapse. One relapse patient was found to have a RANBP2-ABL1 fusion. This patient was a 20 year old female. An IKZF1 intragenic deletion was detected in her leukemia in addition to the RANBP2-ABL1 fusion. She had good initial prednisone response and reached complete remission (CR) after treatment on the GRAALL2005R trial. However, she relapsed with refractory disease. The RANBP2-ABL1 fusion was detected at relapse, and dasatinib (140 mg daily) was added to chemotherapy; this resulted in a brief response even though her leukemia was previously refractory to several lines of salvage treatment (best MRD level 8x10-3). However, the patient experienced another relapse and died of progressive disease. The case illustrates partial response to TKIs in combination with chemotherapy in a relapsed Ph-like B-ALL with RANBP2-ABL1 fusion.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
PPP2R1A P179R mutation	PPP2R1A	NCBI:0	gene		DOID:0			Functional				Pubmed:31142515	Immunoprecipitation experiments in a serous endometrial carcinoma cell line that expressed V5 tagged PPP2R1A P179R protein revealed that binding of PPP2R1A to the PP2A holoenzyme complex members was significantly reduced for PPP2R1A P179R compared to wildtype protein. In vitro reconstitution of the PPP2A holoenzyme was also inhibited by PPP2R1A P179R. Crystal structures of the mutant and wildtype proteins revealed changes in PPP2R1A protein structural conformation that impacts the interaction with the PPP2CA C-subunit, and increases the binding energy between the PPP2R1A and PPP2CA subunits from 236 to 347 kJ/mol for wildtype and mutant protein, respectively. Cell lines that expressed PPP2R1A P179R had increased proteosome-mediated degradation of the PPP2CA (C-subunit), PPP2R2A (B55α) and PPP2R5A (B56α) subunits. Together, this evidence points to PPP2R1A P179R mediated disruption of the PPP2A complex.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
ABL1 RCSD1::ABL1 mutation	ABL1	NCBI:25	gene	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma	DOID:80630			Predictive				Pubmed:25768406	Authors reported a 26 year-old female patient with B-ALL and RCSD1-ABL1 fusion identified by FISH and PCR. Sequencing showed that RCSD1 exon 3 was fused to ABL1 exon 4. This patient was treated with chemotherapy and HSC transplant and relapsed. Ex vivo drug response profiling (DRP) of the patient leukemic blasts was performed at first relapse. Resistance and/or low response were observed for dasatinib and nilotinib, and measurable responses were noted to ponatinib. This differential response to ponatinib as compared with dasatinib was confirmed in a secondary dose-response study and in mice inoculated with leukemia cells. Then the patient was started on ponatinib monotherapy (45 mg/day) based on her RCSD1-ABL1 fusion and achieved a remission. She received a second HSC transplant but relapsed at day 77 post transplantation. Ponatinib was restarted at this time that resulted in response but didn’t reach remission. The patient died of a septic shock 2 weeks later.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
BEND2 CHD7::BEND2 mutation	BEND2	NCBI:0	gene	Pancreatic Endocrine Carcinoma	DOID:1798			Oncogenic				Pubmed:31160355	A 35 year-old patient presented with a grade 3 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor and liver metastasis. Whole genome sequencing and RNAseq revealed a previously undescribed somatic translocation between Chromosome 8 and X (t(8;X)(q12.2;p22.13)), which produces an in-frame CHD7::BEND2 fusion (exon 2 and exon 5). RNA-seq results showed increased expression of BEND2 downstream from the fusion breakpoints, indicating its enhanced expression. The authors hypothesize that activation of BEND2, either by fusion or increased expression, may promote oncogenic activity.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

ATRX Deletion	ATRX	NCBI:0	gene	Cancer	DOID:162			Predictive				Pubmed:23284920	Transgenic mice were generated with conditional knockouts affecting exon 18 of the mouse ATRX gene, previously shown to be an equivalent of a loss of function. Macrophages derived from the knockout mice were significantly more sensitive to 5-FU (P<0.05) compared to macrophages derived from wild-type mice, as demonstrated by reduced survival by TUNEL assays. Re-introduction of ATRX rescued cells from 5-FU treatment. Similar significant (P<0.05) increases in TUNEL-positive cells were seen for ATRX-deficient neurons treated with 5-FU, as well as myoblasts and embryonic fibroblasts treated with 5-FU or cisplatin. The authors conclude that ATRX loss leads to sensitivity to DNA damaging agents.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

TP53 P250L mutation	TP53	NCBI:7157	gene		DOID:0			Functional				Pubmed:21445056	In a pre-clinical study, wild-type and P250L TP53 were transiently overexpressed in the human osteosarcoma SaOS-2 cell line, which lacks endogenous p53. Immunofluorescence revealed that the P250L mutant cell line had reduced nuclear and increased cytoplasmic staining as compared to the wildtype. The punctate staining suggested that the P250L mutant forms large aggregates within the perinucleus. Chemical disruption of the microtubule assembly resulted in a shift from punctate to diffuse cytoplasmic staining in the P250L cell line. The oligomerization state of the wild type and P250L p53 was analyzed using Blue-Native PAGE (BN-PAGE) and western blot analysis: It was found that the wild type p53 appeared as monomers, tetramers and octamers while the P250L p53 formed large masses. More importantly, it was found that the formation of these aggregates by the P250L mutant could lead to co-aggregation of the wild-type p53, causing dominant negative activity. Additionally, the P250L mutant was found to inactivate the p53 paralogs, p63 and p73, while upregulating HSP70 and HSP90.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

Methyltransferase activity assays showed that the Y641 mutants were more effective than the wildtype in catalyzing dimethyl to trimethyl reactions. In comparison to the wildtype, the enzyme turnover and catalytic efficiency for the mutants was lower for the non methylated and monomethylated substrates, and higher for dimethylated substrates. Western blots of patient derived lymphoma cell lines (one homozygous wildtype and four heterozygous Y641 mutant lines) supported steady state enzyme kinetic predictions where the homozygous wildtype line demonstrated increased me1 and me2, but decreased 3me at H3K27. Alternatively, the heterozygous lines displayed increased 3me but decreased me1 and me2 at H3K27.

PTEN C136R mutation	PTEN	NCBI:5728	gene		DOID:0			Functional				Pubmed:23475934	In PHTS-derived lymphoblasts, PTEN protein expression, PTEN mRNA levels, and proteasome activity was measured in the PTEN C136R and control cells. In PTEN-C136R cells, PTEN protein expression was significantly reduced, PTEN mRNA levels was comparable to wildtype(wt), and proteasome activity was 30% greater than wt. This increased proteasomal activity was also found in MCF-7 and HEK-293 cell lines transfected with C136R-PTEN, and in mice expressing C136R-PTEN. Further experiments found the mutant localizes to the cytosol, where its increased proteasomal activity is observed. Cycloheximide (CHX) treatment of MCF-7 cells expressing wt or C136R-PTEN revealed this mutant to be highly unstable. Using P-AKT and P-ERK as markers of PI3K and MAPK pathway activity, respectively, it was found that C136R-PTEN resulted in increased fold change of both, inferring increased pathway activation. The authors further inferred that the mutant results in impaired PTEN lipid phosphatase and protein phosphatase.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

EZH2 Y646F mutation	EZH2	NCBI:2146	gene		DOID:0			Functional				Pubmed:21190999	H3K27me3 (histone H3 Lys-27–specific trimethylation) level was higher in EZH2 (Y641F) bearing germinal center B-cell type DLBCL derived lymphoma cell lines and tumors than in wild-type cells. There was no difference of H3K27Me2 and H3K9Me3 levels between Y641F/N and WT, indicating specificity in a gain of function of Y641F/N. Expression of Y641F mutation in HEK293T cells with wild-type EZH2 led to an increase in H3K27me3. Primary murine B-cell lines with Y641F mutation also showed an increase of H3K27me3. Structural modeling indicated that Y641F/N helped push the equilibrium to favor trimethylated products. A 3H methyl incorporation assay was used to study the activity of the PRC2 complex containing Y641F mutation in vitro. PRC2 complexes containing Y641F showed nearly two times higher activity with H3K27me2 substrates than PRC complexes with wild-type EZH2. This study indicates that EZH2 (Y641F) increases H3K27 trimethylation.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

BRAF G463E mutation	BRAF	NCBI:673	gene	Cancer	DOID:162			Oncogenic				Pubmed:15035987	The BRAF mutation G463E resulted in elevated kinase activity relative to wild-type BRAF in vitro. B-RAF activity was determined using kinase dead MEK as a substrate. G463E activity was 28 times higher than basal WT BRAF. The authors classified G463E activity as intermediate since its kinase activity was between basal WT BRAF and G12V RAS-activated WT B-RAF cells. In comparison, some BRAF variants displayed high kinase activity above the G12V RAS-activated WT BRAF cells. NIH3T3 transformation assay yielded 24 +/- 14 foci/ng of transfected BRAF DNA, in comparison to WT, which yielded zero foci, indicating an oncogenic effect of BRAF G463E.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

The analysis was done using a custom-capture sequencing assay. MYOD1 L122R variant was identified in 17 cases (3%) and was not restricted to spindle-cell histology, but was also observed in association with other histologic patterns (including cases with densely packed cells that mimicked embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) or RMS not otherwise specified ). MYOD1 mutation showed association with older age, head and neck primary site, and a dismal survival. In both COG and UK patient cohorts, patients with the MYOD1 L122R mutation had rapid disease progression and significantly worse event free survival as compared to the patients with wild-type MYOD1.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

The G31A mutation did not lead to tumor formation in the pooled assay but did cause tumor formation in 6/6 mice in the individual experiment. The NFE2L2:p.G31A allele was also found to be expressed at significantly higher levels as compared to wild type. Short term gene expression correlation analysis was also completed using HA1E cells and the L1000 Luminex bead-based gene expression assay. Transcript level of 978 landmark genes were measured to formulate a gene expression signature for the allele. Overexpression of the mutant allele led to a similar signature as overexpression of the wild type, suggesting that the gain-of-function changes induced by the mutant can also be seen in NFE2L2-overexpressed cells.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

TP53 ALTERATION	TP53	NCBI:7157	gene	Rhabdomyosarcoma	DOID:3247			Prognostic				Pubmed:34166060	This study evaluated 641 cases of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) that were enrolled in the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) trials from 1998 to 2017 and the UK malignant mesenchymal tumor and RMS2005 trails from 1995 to 2016. Molecular testing included 39 genes which had been implicated in the past with regards to RMS. The analysis was performed with a custom-capture sequencing assay. Altered TP53 was noted in 69 out of 515 FOXO1 fusion-negative RMS cases (13%), with the most frequent mutations at codons G245S (6 cases), R248Q or W (6 cases), R175H (4 cases), and P72A (4 cases). These cases displayed a worse event free survival. In FOXO1 fusion-positive RMS subtype, there was a small number of cases with altered TP53 (3 and 2 cases in the COG and UK patient cohorts, respectively), but they were universally fatal. Due to lack of a matched germline sample, it could not be determined whether the TP53 abnormalities were of somatic or germline origin. Nevertheless, both cohorts show that mutations in TP53 are associated with a poor prognosis in both fusion-negative and fusion-positive RMS, with a particularly bleak outcome in fusion-positive RMS.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

ERBB2 Amplification	ERBB2	NCBI:2064	gene	Childhood Ependymoma	DOID:5509			Predictive				Pubmed:20713864	From a phase one clinical trial, pediatric patients with refractory CNS malignancies were administered 300-1150 mg/m2 twice daily of ERBB2 and EGFR inhibitor lapatinib. The maximum-tolerated dose was established at 900 mg/m2 twice daily, regardless of steroid use. From the 59 patients, 12 patients, including 5 diagnosed with ependymoma, demonstrated a prolonged stable disease in response to lapatinib. In comparison to other CNS tumors, pretrial samples from patients with ependymoma tumors displayed high expression of ERBB2 and activation of ERBB2 signaling. Due to the high expression of ERBB2 receptors, targeting ERBB2 may be a viable treatment for patients with ependymoma tumors and other high expressing ERBB2 brain tumors.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

Median PFS was 4.2 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 5.4) in the doublet-therapy group, and 1.5 months (95% CI, 1.5 to 1.7) in the control group (hazard ratio for disease progression doublet-group vs control, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.52, P<0.001).	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
EZH2 Y646C mutation	EZH2	NCBI:2146	gene		DOID:0			Functional				Pubmed:20601953	EZH2 mutations were identified in a screen of 614 patients with myeloid malignancies. Several mutations in the highly conserved CXC-SET domains were expressed in Sf9 insect cells along with polycomb repressive complex 2 components EED and SUZ12. Complexes were immunoprecipitated and assayed in vitro for H3K27M methyltransferase activity. EZH2 Y646C resulted in reduced methyltransferase activity, similar to the negative control (SET domain deletion). In addition, the SKM-1 cell line expressing EZH2 Y646C showed reduced H3K27M methyltransferase activity compared to EZH2-unmutated SKK-1 and MOLM-13 cell lines.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
TFE3 ASPSCR1::TFE3 mutation	TFE3	NCBI:0	gene	Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma	DOID:4239			Oncogenic				Pubmed:25453902	Goodwin, et al.

TFE3 ASPSCR1::TFE3 mutation	TFE3	NCBI:0	gene	Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma	DOID:4239			Diagnostic				Pubmed:11244503	Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is characterized by the presence of an unbalanced translocation der(17)t(X;17)(p11;q25).  In this 2001 paper, FISH with YAC and cosmid probes was used to localize the breakpoint to a 160 kb region with additional analyses (including Southern blotting, RACE PCR, and RT-PCR) identifying a fusion between ASPSCR1 (referred to as ASPL in this paper) and the TFE3 transcription factor. RT-PCR performed on 12 ASPS patient samples showed the presence of a fusion transcript containing 5' sequences of the novel gene ASPSCR1 fused with a 3' sequences of TFE3 in all cases. Of note, the reciprocal fusion was not detected in 11 of 12 cases consistent with cytogenetic analysis.  The ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion was absent in control cell lines (K562 leukemia cell line). Like other TFE3 gene fusions reported in cancer, this transcript retains the bHLH-LZ DNA motif, encoded by exons 5 to 7 of TFE3.  The ASPSCR1::TFE3 is of potential clinical utility in ASPS diagnosis.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

The authors used chromosome analysis (FISH) as well as RT-PCR to analyze the fusion. The authors also carried out multiple in vitro studies. The CIC-DUX4 region inserted in NIH 3T3 cells resulted in an increase of anchorage-independent colonies in comparison to the wild-type (indicating potential oncogenic transcription effect). The CIC-DUX4 construct transfected into HeLa cells showed 130 times higher transcriptional activities in comparison to the wild-type. The authors isolated RNA from U2OS cells with CIC-DUX4 fusion, and showed increased expression of 22 genes. Increased expression of ETV1 and ERM was seen in tumor tissue of case 1. The segment including potential ERM gene promoter region (TATA box) was transfected into HeLa and cell line from case 2 tumor tissue (ECD1). The result showed 235 times stronger promoter activity in ECD1 in comparison to the HeLa cell line. Also, the authors co-transfected the promoter region of the ETV1 gene and CIC-DUX4 into HeLa cell lines, which resulted in recognition of the region by the CIC-DUX4.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

IDH1 R132C mutation	IDH1	NCBI:3417	gene	Cancer	DOID:162			Predictive				Pubmed:28148839	IDH1 R132C mutation confers a switch of function mutation where the mutated protein produces 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), rather than α-ketoglutarate (αKG). The novel metabolite induces a homologous recombination (HR) defect that sensitizes the tumor cells to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. PARP inhibitor sensititivity was tested in vivo in HeLa cells where the R132C mutation was create with CRISPR, the HCT116 colon cancer cell line where R132C mutation was created with recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV), and the HT1080 human sarcoma cell line which already has R132C. The results were then duplicated in non-commercial glioma cell lines: 6 IDH1 R132 mutant; 4 IDH1 wt.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

TFE3 Fusion	TFE3	NCBI:0	gene	Renal Cell Carcinoma With MiT Translocations	DOID:81413			Diagnostic				Pubmed:26169997	"This study screened 983 Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) cases and identified 65 tumors with morphologic features suspicious of RCC with Xp11.2 translocation/TFE3 gene fusion (Xp11.2 RCC). TFE3 immunohistochemical staining and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing confirmed 22 of these (34%) were Xp11.2 RCC.  TFE3 rearrangements define RCCs with Xp11.2 translocation/TFE3 gene fusion, which, in the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification, further belongs to the category of ""MiT family translocation renal cell carcinoma."" The MiT family (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor family) translocation RCC comprises of the Xp11 translocation RCC harboring TFE3 gene fusions and the t(6;11) renal cell carcinoma harboring TFEB gene fusion. This study showed that the Xp11.2 translocation/TFE3 gene fusion RCC can be difficult to diagnose by pathology, and that evaluation by FISH is a useful diagnostic tool for this tumor type."	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

PDGFB COL1A1::PDGFB mutation	PDGFB	NCBI:0	gene	Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans	DOID:3507			Oncogenic				Pubmed:17431412	In this study, 57 cases of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) were evaluated. The COL1A1-PDGFB fusion was detected in 42 (74%) out of the 57 sample after performing targeted PCR amplification and direct sequencing. The 42 samples were then evaluated for PDGFB and PDGFRB gene amplification using qPCR. SYBR green assay was also used to evaluate PDGFB gene amplification in comparison with a reference gene and a normal tissue. PDGFB mRNA expression was detected in all analyzed samples and was significantly higher in tumor cells compared to adjacent normal tissue; as amplification levels (copy number of PDGFB/ copy number of reference gene) varied from 0.6. to 8.3 (mean 2.4) in 42 tumor samples, and from 0.4 to 3.0 (mean 1.2) in 20 adjacent normal tissue samples (P = 0.0002). Moreover, the mRNA expression levels of PDGFB and PDGFRB showed a significant correlation (P < 0.0001).  The authors of this study conclude that these results demonstrate the generation of the COL1A1-PDGFB fusion transcript that functions as a ligand for PDGFRB which subsequently activates the downstream PDGFB/PDGFRB signaling pathway involved in tumorigenesis of DFSP.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

This last tumor (EWSR1 ex 9::FLI1 ex4) had evidence of an additional 4 splicing variants corresponding to EWSR1 exon 7 to FLI1 exons 4, 6, 8 and 9.  Two tumors had EWSR1::ERG with breakpoints between exon 7 of EWSR1 and exon 6 of ERG.  Of note, karyotyping only revealed a chromosome 22 rearrangement in 18 out of 27 cases tested (67%), however this was thought to be due to failure to obtain mitotic figures (5 of 9) and insufficient  material (4 of 9).  Authors conclude RT-PCR is better than karyotyping for identifying these EWSR1 rearranged tumors. In this small study, EWSR::FLI1 type I fusion predominated over type II in localized Ewing's and were more abundant in tumors affecting the long bones (9 versus 0), however no correlations between different EWSR1 transcripts and any other clinical parameters could be identified.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

RT-PCR revealed fusion transcripts in 28 of 30 cases (93%) with EWSR1::FLI1 found in 93% (26 of 28) and EWSR1::ERG in 7% (2 of 28).

The two tumors with EWSR1::ERG had breakpoints between exon 7 of EWSR1 and exon 6 of ERG with a t(2;22) rearrangement detected in 1 of these 2 cases by karyotyping.  Authors conclude RT-PCR is a sensitive method for identifying these EWSR1 rearranged tumors.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

NTRK2 KANK1::NTRK2 mutation	NTRK2	NCBI:0	gene	Anaplastic Ependymoma	DOID:5889			Predictive				Pubmed:34651095	An MRI in a previously healthy 6-year-old boy now presenting with neurologic abnormalities and seizers revealed a mass obstructing the foramen of Monro and diffuse leptomeningeal dissemination. The primary tumor was resected and subsequent radiation therapy resulted in moderate cognitive and motor improvements. Seven months later, an MRI detected a recurrence, which led to tumor molecular profiling of patient DNA and RNA. RNA analysis discovered and confirmed an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 e3::ex16 fusion, which was predicted to preserve NTRK2’s tyrosine kinase domain. The patient was started on larotrectinib and within 2 weeks demonstrated cognitive and motor improvements. After 2 months of therapy, an MRI showed significant tumor response and by 4 months cognition and memory were near-baseline. Overall, larotrectinib resulted in both sustained clinical and radiographic response through 10 months of treatment with no related toxicity.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
NTRK2 KANK1::NTRK2 mutation	NTRK2	NCBI:0	gene	Glioblastoma	DOID:3068			Predictive				Pubmed:34041811	An MRI of 26-year-old man presenting with motor weakness and language difficultly revealed a lesion in the left frontal lobe that extended across the corpus callosum. Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

NIH3T3 cells were transfected with the variant construct followed by kinase activity assay that showed increased activity by ~ 4 folds compared to the wild type. The authors suggest that this variant, although showing lower activation levels than other known variants responsible for severe skeletal dysplasia forms, is responsible for the milder skeletal dysplasia form seen in those patients (mild hypochondroplasia phenotype), and they further highlight the significance of Lys650 site in the active domain loop of the receptor.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

The in-frame fusion transcript contained exons 1-2 of EML4 fused to exon 14 of NTRK3 which is predicted to include the entire intact NTRK3 kinase domain. The fusion transcript was cloned through RT-PCR from the patient’s pulmonary tissue and stably transduced with lentivirus into NIH-3T3 cells. These fusion expressing cells demonstrated in vitro anchorage independent growth in a soft agar assay after 21 days. These cell lines also generated large tumors when injected subcutaneously into the flanks of mice after 18 days with tumors exhibiting histology similar to congenital fibrosarcoma.

However, FISH for NTRK1 was negative. The tumor resection was performed by hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic lymph node dissection, and partial vaginal resection. No evidence of lymph node metastasis was noted. Patient underwent 6 course adjuvant chemotherapy.  On a follow-up visit after two months from her last follow up a mass in the right trigeminal nerve area was detected. This was morphologically confirmed as spindle cell sarcoma. NGS and IHC on this tumor specimen confirmed EML4-NTRK3 (e2-e14) fusion and pan-TRK positive, respectively. Tumor recurrence and invasion was noted one month later with a mass protruding from the vaginal external orifice. The mass was resected, and this specimen was positive for Pan-TRK by IHC.

FGFR3 K650E mutation	FGFR3	NCBI:2261	gene		DOID:0			Functional				Pubmed:15843401	A construct of PDGF and FGFR3 was created as a chimeric receptor to study the effect of the K650E variant on downstream signaling pathways. Transfecting PC12 cells showed continuous ligand-independent activity of the chimeric mutant receptor with the presence of an inducer alone (zinc) but not the ligand; PDFG. Upon addition of PDGF, further activation was also observed. Conversely, control cells showed activity only with the addition of both ligand and zinc. Gene expression profiling showed P21 gene was expressed at a higher level (1.7 folds) in mutant receptor cells, providing evidence of ERK1/2 and STAT1/3 activation. The mutant receptor produced a highly sustained ERK1/2 activation even after 1 hour of PDGF treatment, whereas wild-type expressing cells showed a decrease in ERK1/2 activity. Lastly, cells only expressing the variant K650E receptor were able to phosphorylate tyrosine in STAT1, and tyrosine, along with serine, in a ligand-independent manner in STAT3. Authors confirm that mutant FGFR3 activates ERK1/2 and STAT1/3 in a ligand-independent manner and maintains this activation over longer periods of time when treated with ligand than does the wild-type receptor.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

The authors also looked at FGFR3 phosphorylation using western blot analysis and found that FGF2-bound dimers had increased FGFR3 phosphorylation. Therefore it was concluded that the FGF1 bound dimer is the inactive state, while the FGF2 bound dimer is the active state. Common bladder cancer and Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans variant FGFR3 A391E dimerization and phosphorylation were measured via FRET and western blot assays respectively.

BCOR ITD  mutation	BCOR	NCBI:0	gene	Central Nervous System Tumor With BCOR Internal Tandem Duplication	DOID:81315			Diagnostic				Pubmed:26919435	The authors generated genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of 323 tumors with an institutional diagnosis of ‘primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the central nervous system (CNS-PNETs)’,  which  are highly aggressive, poorly differentiated embryonal tumors occurring predominantly in young children but also affecting adolescents and adults. Four novel methylation profiles were identified. One of those profiles was exhibited by 10/323 (3 %) cases,  and all these tumors were found to have a duplicated region in exon 15 of BCOR [BCOR internal tandem duplication (ITD)] by DNA/RNA sequencing, identical to that of the BCOR ITD in other tumor types including clear cell sarcomas of the kidney, undifferentiated round cell sarcomas in infants, and primitive myxoid mesenchymal tumour of infancy. The authors compared DNA methylation pattern of the BCOR-ITD positive cases with an in-house collection of > 10,000 methylation profiles from a broad variety of pediatric and adult CNS tumors. Additional tumors with variety of histologies showed the same methylation profile as BCOR-ITD positive cases, and were also found to have BCOR-ITD. The authors proposed that BCOR-ITD defines a specific molecular subtype of  CNS tumors.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

The study initially evaluated 3 CCSK samples by whole exome sequencing and whole transcriptome sequencing. All 3 samples demonstrated BCOR ITD by RNA sequencing. This was further validated by targeted DNA sequencing of a validation institutional cohort of 11 primary and 2 matched metastatic CCSK cases, and an additional external cohort of 13 CCSK samples. Overall, BCOR ITDs were found in 85% (23/27 cases). No BCOR ITDs were found in neither matched normal kidney/blood, nor other childhood renal cancers. Upregulation of mutant BCOR transcripts and protein expression by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry was shown.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

BCOR  encodes a key constituent of a variant polycomb repressive complex (PRC). Similar to BCOR::CCNB3-related tumors, transcriptome analysis revealed enrichment of PRC2-associated target genes including those associated with H3 K28 trimethylation. Disruption of polycomb repressive complex signaling likely plays a role in the pathogenesis of CCSK.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
BCOR ITD  mutation	BCOR	NCBI:0	gene	Central Nervous System Tumor With BCOR Internal Tandem Duplication	DOID:81315			Oncogenic				Pubmed:26919435	10/323 studied high-grade primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the central nervous system (CNS-HGPNETs)  clustered together based on their unique methylation profile. 10/10 of those tumors exhibited in-frame internal tandem duplications in the BCOR gene. The duplicated region was identical with that of the BCOR ITDs described in clear cell sarcoma of the kidney. 1 additional tumor harbored a BCOR intragenic in-frame deletion, and two additional tumors had BCOR frameshift mutations. Gene expression of BCOR was higher in CNS HG PNET BCOR-ITD positive tumors than in other CNS tumor types, suggesting different mechanism from BCOR loss-of-function mutations reported in other malignancies,. The results are consistent with BCOR-ITDs acting as primary oncogenic drivers in a unique type of CNS HG PNETs.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

IDH1 R132 mutation	IDH1	NCBI:3417	gene	Cholangiocarcinoma	DOID:4947			Predictive				Pubmed:32416072	The multicenter randomized double-blind phase 3 study included patients with IDH1-mutant cholangiocarcinoma who had progressed on previous therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to Ivosidenib or placebo. Placebo to Ivosidenib crossover was permitted on radiological progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by independent central review. Progression-free survival was significantly improved with Ivosidenib compared with the placebo (median 2.7, vs 1.4 months; hazard ratio 0.37; 95% CI 0.25-0.54; one-side p<0.0001). Median overall survival was 10.8 months for the Ivosidenib group versus 9.7 months for the placebo group (HR 0.69 [95% CI 0.44-1.10]; p=0.060) in which 35 patients were crossover from the placebo group. In a prespecified exploratory analysis, the rank-preserving structural failure time (RPSFT) method was used to reconstruct the survival curve for patients receiving a placebo as if crossover had never occurred. RPSFT assumes that the treatment effect is the same for all patients, regardless of when the treatment is given. The RPSFT-adjusted median overall survival was 6.0 months for the placebo group (HR 0.46 [95% CI 0.28-0.75]; p=0.0008).	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
BCOR ITD  mutation	BCOR	NCBI:0	gene	Central Nervous System Tumor With BCOR Internal Tandem Duplication	DOID:81315			Diagnostic				Pubmed:31104347	10 cases of high-grade neuroepithelial tumor  (HGNET) with BCOR exon 15 ITD were studied. In addition, 25 previously reported and published patients were included in survival analyses. These tumors are newly proposed to belong to a separate entity with a distinct methylation profile and a characteristic genetic alteration. The authors further describe  their clinical, pathologic, radiographic, and genetic features. Shared histologic characteristics included predominantly solid growth, glioma‐like fibrillarity, perivascular pseudorosettes, and palisading necrosis, but absence of microvascular proliferation. Immunohistochemistry testing showed absent GFAP expression, no synaptophysin expression, variable OLIG2 and NeuN positivity, and diffuse strong BCOR nuclear positivity. In 6 of 10 cases, BCOR ex15 ITD was the only pathogenic alteration seen, while other cases showed additional genetic abnormalities including CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion, TERT amplification or promoter hotspot mutation, and damaging mutations in TP53, BCORL1, EP300, SMARCA2 and STAG2. The authors conclude that their findings further support inclusion of HG NET with BCOR ex15 ITD as a distinct CNS tumor entity.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

NGS assay (Foundation One CDX panel) detected the EGRF::RAD51 fusion. He was treated with platinum -based agents and palliative radiation therapy to the spine. Once the disease was stable as per RECIST guidelines, treatment was switched to Osimertinib. Marked improvement was seen within two weeks with reduction in lymph node metastases and reduction in back pain. Dramatic reductions in brain lesions were observed after 2 months of treatment (Fig 1 and Fig 2).

NGS detected the presence of KIF5B::EGFR fusion (exon 15 and exon 18). The patient received two cycles of chemotherapy but experienced disease progression to lymph nodes and left rib after 13 months. The lymph nodes showed both squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. He was then treated with afatinib and showed progression-free survival for 11 months, after which intracranial metastasis was observed, and treatment with afatinib was discontinued. Following a whole brain radiation therapy, the patient was treated with Osimertinib for 4 months due to the detection of a known resistance marker T790M, however only a limited benefit was seen and the treatment was discontinued. The authors conclude the detection of the novel KIF5B-EGFR fusion in advanced NSCLC was a good indicator of response to afatinib.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

SRSF2 P95H mutation	SRSF2	NCBI:0	gene	Myeloid Neoplasm	DOID:70004			Predictive				Pubmed:10.1182/blood-2021-148205	Several splicing factors known to drive myeloid neoplasms (including SRSF2) require phosphorylation by CLK family kinases for nuclear translocation. The authors describe development of an inhibiter of a CLK family kinase called CTX-712 and evaluate its efficacy in cell line and murine models. CTX-712 efficacy was confirmed in MDS/AML-derived xenografts (PDX). One PDX model with an SRSF2 P95H variant showed a significant response to CTX-712 in a dose-dependent manner. 4 out of 5 mice receiving a high dose protocol achieved complete remission. CLK inhibition also induced aberrant splicing events including skipped exons and this effect was more prevalent in the SRSF2-mutated model.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

MYB MYB::QKI mutation	MYB	NCBI:0	gene	Angiocentric Glioma	DOID:81261			Diagnostic				Pubmed:26829751	A comprehensive genomic analysis was conducted on 172 cases of pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) across various histologic subtypes, utilizing whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and/or RNA sequencing. The study identified recurrent somatic alterations in 154 tumors (90%), encompassing all 140 tumors subjected to WGS. Among the seven angiocentric gliomas (AGs) examined, six displayed intrachromosomal deletions leading to MYB::QKI rearrangements, and the remaining one contained a MYB::ESR1 rearrangement. To validate these findings, 12 additional AGs with only formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue were analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (n=9) or whole-exome sequencing (WES) and/or array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) (n=3). All tested cases were confirmed to harbor MYB rearrangement or deletion, though the specific gene partners were not determined. Functional studies both in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that MYB::QKI rearrangements facilitate tumorigenesis through activating MYB through truncation of a 3' region, driving aberrant MYB::QKI expression through enhancer translocation, and losing a single copy of the QKI tumor suppressor gene. The research concluded that MYB::QKI represents a novel recurrent fusion defining AGs diagnostically.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

Targeted NGS analysis on the pleural biopsy using the Oncomine Comprehensive Assay v3 panel identified the EML4::NTRK3 (e2::e14) fusion. This fusion was confirmed by both fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, using NTRK3 and EML4 Dual Color Break Apart probes and panTRK antibody IHC staining. Entrectinib was started and two months later PET scan and brain MR revealed partial response. After 5 months of treatment, complete response was observed in the lungs and brain. As of publication, the patient was still being treated with entrectinib, and their most recent PET and MR scan taken 1 year and 5 months into treatment demonstrated maintained complete response in the brain and lungs.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

The patients were treated with a dose of 800 mg twice a day and an objective response was reached only in the patient with the GCB-DLBCL type (complete response), while the other two had progressive disease status. Since EZH2 is known to be expressed in GC and have a role in cellular proliferation and differentiation, the authors speculate that the the cellular origin of DLBCL might be a key in predicting the efficacy of Tazemetostat.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

NTRK3 EML4::NTRK3 mutation	NTRK3	NCBI:0	gene	Congenital Fibrosarcoma	DOID:8418			Diagnostic				Pubmed:27148571	This case study detailed a 9-month-old male with congenital fibrosarcoma with subsequent metastasis to the lungs. The patient had a history of hemimelia in the same limb as the congenital fibrosarcoma, but no known family history and no known prenatal exposures. Because the typical ETV6::NTRK3 fusion was not found, more extensive molecular profiling was done. A t(2;15)(p21;q24) translocation was identified by cytogenetics and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) showed clear copy-number transitions within EML4 and NTRK3. An EML4::NTRK3 (e2::e14) fusion was confirmed by RNA sequencing. This fusion was in-frame with breakpoints at exon 2 of EML4 and exon 14 of NTRK3. Stable lentiviral transduction of this fusion into NIH-3T3 cells induced soft agar colony growth in vitro and tumors in vivo. Based on similar positive cellular transformation and functional motifs to the typically found ETV6::NTRK3, the authors conclude other fusion partners like EML4::NTRK3 can contribute to the development of congenital fibrosarcoma.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
PAX5 P80R mutation	PAX5	NCBI:0	gene	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma With PAX5 P80R	DOID:0			Diagnostic				Pubmed:30510083	RNA-seq transcriptome analysis in a discovery cohort of 170 B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL)  cases negative for the common classifying cytogenetic aberrations identified several well-defined hierarchical expression clusters. Four clusters corresponded to known oncogenic subtypes, namely ZNF384, ERG/DUX4, BCR::ABL1-like, and KMT2A/MLL-rearranged. An additional cluster comprised 14 cases (8.2%), which lacked any fusion gene. Mutational analysis of RNA-seq data revealed the presence of a unique PAX5 mutation, c.239C>G, p.Pro80Arg (p.P80R), in all cases. In an additional cohort of 419 unselected BCP-ALL cases, PAX5 P80R was identified in 16 (5.3%).

NTRK3 NTRK3::SCAPER mutation	NTRK3	NCBI:0	gene	Pigmented Epithelioid Melanocytoma	DOID:0			Oncogenic				Pubmed:31437301	A 4 year old African American girl was seen for a lesion on the scalp. Punch biopsy was done on a largely skin-colored subcutaneous nodule. Subcutaneous nodular aggregations of heavily pigmented epithelioid melanocytes were seen, with melanophages and a small amount of lymphocytes. Proliferation index (Ki-67) was less than 5%. The child was diagnosed with Pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma (PEM), which usually occurs spontaneously as solitary neoplasms in otherwise healthy patients, and rarely spreads beyond the lymph node basin. Comparative genomic hybridization array showed gains and losses at 15q and losses at 17q. The authors note that melanoma often shows three or more segmental amplifications or deletions in reproducible loci, but the alterations in this patient were not commonly seen. A breakpoint was seen in the amplified regions involving the NTRK3 gene with an amplification of 5' end and loss of 3' end and this indicated a possible fusion. Next generation sequencing confirmed the presence of NTRK3 amplification at the 5' end and loss at the 3' end. In addition, an in-frame fusion with NTRK3 at the 5' end was found involving NTRK3 exons 1 to 7 and SCAPER exons 13 to 31 as the 3' partner. This fusion did not include NTRK3 kinase domain (exons 13-18). The tumor was excised with narrow margins and follow up showed no evidence for underlying Carney complex.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

TFE3 ASPSCR1::TFE3 mutation	TFE3	NCBI:0	gene	Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma	DOID:4239			Diagnostic				Pubmed:21835426	In this 2012 paper, the authors assessed potential characteristic markers in 24 alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS cases), age range from 13 to 61 years, and 23 non-ASPS tumors. Nuclear immunoreactivity for the TFE3 protein was observed in 22 of 24 ASPS specimens. The ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion transcript was detected by RT-PCR in all 24 cases and was not detected in any of the 23 non-ASPS tumors. The ASPSCR1::TFE3 involves either exon 3 or 4 of TFE3 fused to ASPSCR1, which replaces the N-terminus of TFE3 but retains the DNA-binding region, activation domain, and nuclear localization signal. The fusion transcripts were composed of 7 type 1 (ASPCR1 fusion to TFE3 exon 4) and 17 type 2 (ASPCR1 fusion to TFE3 exon 3) transcripts.

Of note, ASPSCR1::TFE3 is referred to by the alternative name ASPL-TFE3 in this paper.

TFE3 ASPSCR1::TFE3 mutation	TFE3	NCBI:0	gene	Renal Cell Carcinoma With MiT Translocations	DOID:81413			Diagnostic				Pubmed:11438465	Argani, et al. (2001) included eight morphologically distinctive renal cell carcinomas with the t(X;17) translocation as seen in alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), with the distinction that the t(X;17) translocation is cytogenetically balanced in these renal tumors. The patients ranged from 17 months to 17 years of age. RT-PCR performed on the extracted RNA identified the ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion product in all eight cases. Seven of the cases contained the type 1 product, a fusion of ASPSCR1 to TFE3 exon 4, whereas one cases showed a type 2 product, a fusion of ASPSCR1 to TFE3 exon 3.   These cases were initially diagnosed as renal cell carcinoma (RCC) but upon further analysis were recognized to contain similarities to ASPS, likely due to the ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion suggesting they are a distinctive subset of RCC. Of note, ASPSCR1::TFE3 is referred to by the alternative name ASPL-TFE3 in this paper.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
TFE3 Fusion	TFE3	NCBI:0	gene	Renal Cell Carcinoma With MiT Translocations	DOID:81413			Diagnostic				Pubmed:26975036	Argani. et al,. (2016) included a total of 60 cases with known TFE3 gene rearrangements in this study of Xp11 translocation positive neoplasms (47 RCC, 8 PEComa, and 5 melanotic renal cancers). The age range for the RCC cases was 5 to 73 years. Fusion partners of TFE3 were identified using FISH (with confirmation by RNA sequencing in 5 cases) for 41/47 RCC cases, and included 7 SFPQ::TFE3 (PSF), 16 PRCC::TFE3, 12 ASPSCR1::TFE3 (ASPL), 5 NONO::TFE3, and 1 DVL2::TFE3. For the remaining 6 cases, the fusion partner of TFE3 was unable to be determined. The authors conclude that despite an identical gene fusion, the RCCs are distinct from the corresponding mesenchymal neoplasms and that the data can expand further the clinicopathologic features of cancers with specific TFE3 gene fusions.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
TFEB Fusion	TFEB	NCBI:0	gene	Renal Cell Carcinoma With MiT Translocations	DOID:81413			Diagnostic				Pubmed:34986355	Bakouny, et al. (2022) performed a comprehensive study of the molecular and clinical features of translocation renal cell carcinomas (tRCCs), defined as subtype of kidney cancer driven by MiT/TFE gene fusions. Across the combined tRCC cohort, the majority of cases (78 cases; 88.6%) harbored TFE3 fusions, while the remainder harbored TFEB (8 cases; 9.1%) or MITF (2 cases; 2.3%) fusions.  Four different TFEB fusion partners were observed including CADM2, CLTC, COL21A1 and MALAT1. TFEB and MITF fusion partners tended to preserve less of the N-terminal fusion partner in the fusion product compared to TFE3. The authors conclude that most tRCCs harbor few somatic alterations apart from MiT/TFE fusions.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
TFEB Fusion	TFEB	NCBI:0	gene	Renal Cell Carcinoma With MiT Translocations	DOID:81413			Diagnostic				Pubmed:22895266	Renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) with t(6;11)(p21;q12) are extremely rare and are characterized by a specific chromosome translocation involving the transcription factor EB (TFEB). Identification of either overexpression of the TFEB protein or translocation is a useful method for the diagnosis of TFEB RCCs. However, the results of immunostainings can be inconsistent. This 2012 study included 7 genetically confirmed cases of this rare tumor. The patients’ ages ranged from 21 to 37 years.  All of these tumors showed moderate to strong immunoreactivity for TFEB. DNA PCR performed on genomic DNA extracted from FFPE tissue samples of the tumor identified the Alpha::TFEB fusion gene in 2 cases.  The TFEB partner gene MALAT1 (Alpha) is an intronless, untranslated (non-protein coding) gene of unknown function. The Alpha::TFEB fusion genes were not identified in the other 5 cases. Using a FISH split probe assay all 7 TFEB RCCs showed a high percentage of cells with separation signals, and using a fusion probe assay all 7 TFEB RCCs demonstrated fusion signals. They concluded that the diagnosis of such tumors should be based not only on morphology itself but also on immunophenotype and molecular genetic findings.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
YAP1 YAP1::TFE3 mutation	YAP1	NCBI:0	gene	Malignant Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma	DOID:80190			Diagnostic				Pubmed:23737213	This study by Antonescu, et al. (2013) included 10 cases with a diagnosis of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE), which showed unusual morphologic features such as abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, mature vascular channel formation and were negative for WWTR1 and CAMTA1 rearrangements by FISH. Patients ranged in age from 14 to 50 years. RNA sequencing identified a YAP1::TFE3 fusion transcript, and RT-PCR confirmed the fusion transcript of YAP1 exon 1 to exon 4 of TFE3. All 10 cases investigated by FISH showed TFE3 break-apart signal, and 8 of the 10 also showed YAP1 rearrangement.  A control group of similar tumor types which included 18 epithelioid hemangiomas, 9 pseudomyogenic HE, and 3 epithelioid angiosarcomas showed no TFE3 rearrangements suggesting the YAP1::TFE3 is specific for this subgroup of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

YAP1 YAP1::TFE3 mutation	YAP1	NCBI:0	gene	Malignant Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma	DOID:80190			Oncogenic				Pubmed:34381186	This 2021 paper by Dermawan, et al. included 24 cases of YAP1::TFE3 fusion-positive epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas (EHE), with an age range of 20 to 78 years old. All cases were confirmed by molecular testing to harbor YAP1::TFE3 gene fusions, 88% with YAP1 exon 1 fused to TFE3 exon 4 and 12% with YAP1 exon 1 fused to TFE3 exon 6. The predicted fusion protein contains the TEAD binding site of YAP1 (located in exon 1), which is essential for tethering the protein to genes to activate transcription, and swaps the YAP1 transactivating domain for the basic helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper domains of TFE3. Thus the fusion protein acts as a transcription factor that utilizes the transactivating domains and nuclear localization sequences of TFE3 and binds DNA through the TEAD binding site on YAP1, resulting in a constitutively active chimeric transcription factor. YAP1 and WWTR1 (TAZ) are highly homologous transcriptional co-regulators that are downstream nuclear effectors of the Hippo signaling pathway. In EHE with WWTR1::CAMTA1 gene fusion, WWTR1::CAMTA1 acts as a constitutively active form of TAZ. Thus the a YAP-like transcriptional program in YAP1::TFE3 fused EHE, is considered analogous to WWTR1::CAMTA1 EHE (PMID: 33913810).	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
TFEB Fusion	TFEB	NCBI:0	gene	Renal Cell Carcinoma With MiT Translocations	DOID:81413			Diagnostic				Pubmed:15644781	A subset of renal neoplasms of children and young adults contains t(6;11)(p21;q12), fusion of the MALAT1 (Alpha) gene with the transcription factor gene TFEB. Argani, et al. (2005) included 7 renal neoplasms with cytogenetic and/or molecular evidence of the t(6;11)(p21;q12). The patients ranged from 9 to 33 years in age. All of the 7 renal neoplasms demonstrated either moderate or strong nuclear immunoreactivity for TFEB protein, and 1089 other neoplasms were tested but none showed significant labeling for TFEB. In 3 cases frozen tissue was available for RNA extraction, and RT-PCR detected the MALAT1(Alpha0::TFEB fusion. The potentially wide size range of MALAT1(Alpha)::TFEB fusion transcripts complicates the detection of this fusion by RT-PCR for robust detection in clinical RNA samples. The lack of splice signals in Alpha resulted in DNA PCR products of the same size as the RT-PCR products when the reverse primer binds to TFEB exon 3. The authors conclude that immunoreactivity for TFEB protein is a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic marker for these renal neoplasms and suggest that long-range DNA PCR may a useful alternative to RT-PCR due to the special molecular features of the Alpha::TFEB gene fusion.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
NTRK1 LMNA::NTRK1 mutation	NTRK1	NCBI:4914	gene	Lipofibromatosis-like Neural Tumor	DOID:80894			Diagnostic				Pubmed:32519338	A 31-year-old female presented with a pigmented nodule on her scalp that enlarged in size over a 2-year period. Biopsy demonstrated a fascicular proliferation of bland spindle cells within the dermis and subcutaneous tissue and was found in adipose tissue in a “honeycomb pattern.” Immunohistochemical staining revealed the spindle cells were positive for CD34 and S-100 protein and were negative for SOX10. FISH was negative for PDGFB rearrangement. The spindle cells were positive for pan-NTRK by IHC and targeted RNA sequencing revealed the LMNA::NTRK1 e2::e10 fusion. The patient’s tumor was completely excised, and no evidence of recurrence or metastatic disease was found at 24-month follow-up. The authors indicate the tumor analyses demonstrate a diagnosis of a NTRK-rearranged LPF-NT with unusual histopathological findings that include lymphoid aggregates and pigmented dendritic melanocytes.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

Biopsy revealed a spindle cell mesenchymal tumor with monotonous, bland spindle cells mixed with fat and blood vessels. IHC was positive for CD34, S-100, and pan-TRK and negative for Sox10. Due to the unusual tumor location, an anchored multiplex PCR-based targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) RNA fusion panel was used and detected a predicted in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 (e2:e11) that retains the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain.

The patient was enrolled into a phase II trial and treated with 600mg of entrectinib daily. After 1 month, the mass showed near-complete loss of enhancement and density (Hounsfield units dropped from 200 to 55-60). At week 12, response plateau was reached with the lesion reducing by 45% (RECIST 1.1). Due to the exceptional response, vertebrectomy was possible and completed.

BCOR ITD  mutation	BCOR	NCBI:0	gene	Central Nervous System Tumor With BCOR Internal Tandem Duplication	DOID:81315			Diagnostic				Pubmed:29226988	Six cases of CNS high-grade neuroepithelial tumor (HGNET) with BCOR exon 15 internal tandem duplication (ITD) were studied. The authors analyzed their clinical, pathologic and molecular characteristic and compared them with Clear Cell Sarcoma of Kidney (CCSK) and soft tissue sarcoma with the same genetic abnormality (BCOR ex15 ITD). Cases of CNS HGNET with BCOR ex15 ITD were histologically characterized by glial cell morphology, ependymoma-like perivascular pseudorosettes and palisading necrosis. Immunohistochemically, they showed diffuse staining of Olig2, and focal staining of GFAP, S-100 protein and synaptophysin. Clinically, histologically and immunohistochemically CNS  HG NETs with BCOR ex15 ITD were distinct from CCSK and soft tissue sarcomas with BCOR ex15 ITD, supporting that these should be considered a unique type of CNS tumor.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

FISH analysis for MDM2 and CDK4 amplification was also performed. A total of 9 RMS (4 pediatric and 5 adult type) cases were positive for MYOD1 p.L122R hotspot mutation which included all 5 sclerosing RMS and 4/11 spindle cell RMS (2/3 pediatric and 2/8 adult). 3/9 MYOD1-mutant RMS showed additional PIK3CA mutation in exon 9 while no kinase domain (exon 20) mutations were identified.

The remaining 15 cases were diagnosed in patients older than age of one (2-17 years old); 10 showed MYOD1 p.L122R mutation, 4 of which showed an additional concomitant PIK3CA mutation. Cases with both PIK3CA and MYOD1 mutations were uniformly characterized by a sclerosing histology. MYOD1 mutation was homozygous in 8 cases. Patients with VGLL2 or NCOA2 fusion-positive RMS were alive and well on follow-up (median of 7 years) and none developed distant metastases. 7 of 9 patients with MYOD1 mutant RMS died of the disease with a median of 1.5 years. 3 fusion/MYOD1 negative cases with available follow up show no evidence of disease.

BCOR ITD  mutation	BCOR	NCBI:0	gene	Sarcoma	DOID:1115			Diagnostic				Pubmed:27428733	BCOR expression was evaluated in a cohort of 25 small blue round cell tumors (SBRCTs) with BCOR fusions (BCOR::MAML3, BCOR::CCNB3), BCOR exon 15 ITDs, or YWHAE-NUTM2B fusion (which is known to upregulate BCOR) using anti-BCOR monoclonal antibody clone C-10 (sc-514576) as an immunohistochemical marker. A control group consisted of 20 small blue round cell tumors (SBRCTs)  with various non-BCOR genetic abnormalities, 10 fusion-negative SBRCTs, 74 synovial sarcomas, 29 rhabdomyosarcomas, and other sarcoma types. All SBRCTs with BCOR-fusions and most tumors with BCOR ITD (93%), showed strong and diffuse nuclear BCOR immunoreactivity; these tumors were also positive for SATB2 expression. Sarcomas with BCOR fusions and BCOR-ITDs share molecular features (including high BCOR expression and the presence of SATB2 expression), and BCOR immunohistochemical stain is a highly sensitive marker for SBRCTs with BCOR abnormalities.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

Clinicopathologic characterization of these 7 cases with FUS fusions and 8 FUS-rearranged SBRCTs reported in the literature described the morphology as monomorphic round cell cytomorphology (keeping with a classic Ewing sarcoma phenotype) with diffuse membranous CD99 reactivity in all except one case with patchy staining.  Of note, there were 4 patients in this group who had scored negative for EWSR1 FISH that were positive for EWSR1::ERG  by other means (FusionSeq, RT-PCR, etc.) and the authors caution of the false negatives with EWSR1 FISH due to the complexity of the the EWSR1::ERG rearrangement.

PIK3CA Mutation	PIK3CA	NCBI:5290	gene	Cancer	DOID:162			Predictive				Pubmed:35138919	In this phase II NCI-MATCH trial subprotocol I, 61 patients harbouring activating PIK3CA mutations were treated with taselisib. The cohort didn't include any patients with breast or squamous cell lung carcinoma, or patients harboring KRAS or PTEN mutations. No complete responses or PRs were observed in the cohort, the best response being SD in 52% of the patients. The six-month PFS rate was 19.9% (90% CI; 12-29.3), and the PFS was 3.1 months (90% CI; 1.8-3.7). The six-month OS rate was 60.7% (90% CI; 49.6-70), and the OS was 7.2 months (90% CI; 5.9-10.0). Overall, the study reported very limited activity of taselisib in patients with PIK3CA mutations and concluded that the presence of PIK3CA mutation alone is not a sufficient predictor of the drug's activity.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
YAP1 YAP1::TFE3 mutation	YAP1	NCBI:0	gene	Malignant Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma	DOID:80190			Diagnostic				Pubmed:34381186	This 2021 paper by Dermawan, et al. was a multi-institutional clinicopathological study of 24 cases of YAP1::TFE3 fusion-positive epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas (EHE), with an age range of 20 to 78 years old. All cases were confirmed by molecular testing to harbor YAP1::TFE3 gene fusions, 88% with YAP1 exon 1 fused to TFE3 exon 4 and 12% with YAP1 exon 1 fused to TFE3 exon 6. While conventional WWTR1::CAMTA1 EHE is characterized by relatively uniform morphology, YAP1::TFE3 fused hemangioendothelioma exhibits remarkable inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity with distinctive morphologic features not seen in conventional EHE. A striking clinical characteristic of YAP1::TFE3 fused hemangioendothelioma was that large proportion of patients survive many years with stable disease despite having multifocal disease and distant metastasis. The authors propose categorizing YAP1::TFE3 epithelioid hemangioendothelioma as a distinct disease entity from conventional epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (which typically harbors WWTR1::CAMTA1 fusions) due to its clinical and histopathologic characteristics.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
TFE3 Fusion	TFE3	NCBI:0	gene	Renal Cell Carcinoma With MiT Translocations	DOID:81413			Diagnostic				Pubmed:19228722	A study of 443 renal cell carcinoma identified 7 cases with an Xp11 translocation. The median age of the 7 patients was 41 years (range, 15 to 59 years). Of the 244 cases with a successful karyotype, 4 were identified to have an Xp11 translocation. The fusion types of two cases were determined to be PSF::TFE3 and PRCC::TFE3. The other two cases were assumed to have the ASPSCR1::TFE3 gene fusion. The ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion in one cases was confirmed by RT-PCR. Likewise, the PRCC::TFE3 fusion was detected by RT-PCR and confirmed by direct sequencing. Of the 199 samples, for which the karyotype was not determined 3 cases were assumed Xp11 translocation by positive immunostaining for TFE3.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

Three other tumors harbored alternative PAX fusions (2 PAX3::NCOA1, 1 PAX3::INO80D). Unsupervised clustering of transcriptome expression showed that those cases clustered closely to the other alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas that had the classical PAX3/7::FOXO1 fusion. The remaining cases (n=94), including 7 alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma histology tumors were fusion negative. The latter showed somatic mutation and expression profile more consistent with embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas.

Across the combined tRCC cohort, the majority of cases (88.6%) harbored TFE3 fusions with 12 different fusion partners identified.  ASPSCR1 (13), SFPQ (13), PRCC (13), NONO (5), MED15 (4), RBM10 (4) were recurrent partners while U2AF2, MATR3, LUC7L3, KHSRP, FUBP1, and DVL2 were each seen in 1 case.

MYB MYB::QKI mutation	MYB	NCBI:0	gene	Angiocentric Glioma	DOID:81261			Diagnostic				Pubmed:26810070	Comprehensive molecular studies through whole genome, whole exome, transcriptome sequencing, genome-wide copy number analysis, clustering analysis by DNA methylation profiling, as well as mutation hotspot analysis by Sanger sequencing and FISH were performed in a cohort of 91 low-grade neuroepithelial tumors (LGNTs) in 2016. Molecular alterations were detected in 31/32 (97%) of LGNTs with an astrocytic morphology, including 17 diffuse astrocytomas and 15 angiocentric gliomas, and the dominant lesions were MYB fusions (21/32; 66%). A MYB::QKI fusion characterized almost all angiocentric gliomas (13/15; 87%) with the reamining two tumors harborting a MYB::ESR1 fusion (1/15) or QKI rearrangement (1/15). The last case with QKI rearrangement had no apparent involvement of MYB or MYBL1, only showing split signals using FISH break-apart probes across QKI. However, the study did not have sufficient derivatives from this tumor for FFPE RNA-seq, so it was unable to determine whether a cryptic MYB::QKI aberration was present in this case, or whether QKI was fused to another gene partner. Most MYB::QKI fusions (78%) were between MYB exon 15 and QKI exon 5. Fusions were also identified between MYB exon 9 and QKI exon 5. These fusions removed the 3'UTR regulatory site or the entire inhibitory C-terminal domain of MYB, leading to its overexpression. Two tumors with a MYB::QKI fusion also harbored a BRAF p.V600E mutation.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

MYB MYB::QKI mutation	MYB	NCBI:0	gene	Angiocentric Glioma	DOID:81261			Diagnostic				Pubmed:31595312	The study compiled clinicopathologic and molecular features of 46 gliomas with a MYB or MYBL1 alteration diagnosed at a single center. The tumors showed low-grade histopathologic features and were broadly classified as diffuse astrocytoma (n = 11) or angiocentric glioma (n=35). Molecular alterations interrogated by immunohistochemistry (n=46), RNA sequencing (n=29), FISH (n=24), or PCR-based sequencing (n=11) revealed MYB (n=44) or MYBL1 (n=2) alterations in all tumors. MYB and MYBL1 were fused with various gene partners. None had alterations in IDH1, IDH2, TP53, ATRX, or histone H3 genes. Regardless of histopathologic diagnosis or anatomic location, DNA methylome profiling on 35 MYB/MYBL1-altered gliomas formed a single cluster, supporting that MYB/MYBL1-altered gliomas represent a single disease entity with a range of clinical and pathologic characteristics. Only MYB rearrangements were detected in angiocentric gliomas. Of the 35 angiocentric gliomas, 22 had identified gene partners, primarily QKI (n=19), PCDHGA1 (n=1), LOC105378099 (n=1) and ESR1 (n=1).	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

The most significant event, focal 8q13.1 gain, was observed in 28% (5/18) of diffuse astrocytoma grade IIs (DA2), resulting in partial duplication of the transcription factor MYBL1 with truncation of its C-terminal negative-regulatory domain. A recurrent deletion-truncation breakpoint between exons 10 and 11 of MYB on 6q23.3 was identified in two of four angiocentric gliomas (AGs). This study did not mention the partner genes involved in the MYB rearrangements in the two AGs.

Molecular alterations were detected in 31/32 (97%) of LGNTs with an astrocytic morphology, including 17 diffuse astrocytomas and 15 angiocentric gliomas, and no IDH mutations were detected in these tumors. MYB (n=5) or MYBL1 (n=2) rearrangement fusions were detected in 41% (7/17) of diffuse astrocytomas, while the remaining tumors had alternations involving BRAF (n = 4), FGFR1/3 (n = 4), and others (n = 2). The gene partners involving MYB fusions in diffuse astrocytomas included PCDHGA1, LOC154902, and MMP16 and the gene parterners involivng MYBL included MMP16. In contrast, a MYB fusion (most frequently MYB::QKI) characterized almost all angiocentric gliomas (14–15). Only one other tumor across the series (an oligodendroglioma) had a MYB fusion (MYB::MAML2). MYB/MYBL-altered LGNTs clustered together with methylation profiling.

IDH1/2-wildtype status was verified by Sanger sequencing of 24 cases with sufficient DNA. Integrating copy number and RNA sequencing demonstrated MYBL1 (n=14) or MYB (n=6) alterations in 77% (20/26) of these tumors. Nine tumors had MYBL1 rearrangements (including one involving 5’ of MYBL1) with various gene partners, including MMP16 (n=3), RAD51B (n=1), MAML2 (n=1), ZFHX4 (n=1), TOX (n=1), RP11-586K2.1 (intergenic region) (n=1), and RP11492M23.2 (intergenic region) (n=1). These fusions resulted in a deletion of the C-terminal negative regulatory C-myb domain of MYBL1.  Copy number analysis revealed gain or loss involving MYBL1 in 10 tumors, including six with MYBL1 fusion and four without MYBL1 fusions detected. Increased MYBL1 expression was observed in 71% (10/14) of the tumors with MYBL1 alterations.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

The most significant event, focal 8q13.1 gain, was observed in 28% (5/18) of diffuse astrocytoma grade IIs (DA2). All five DA2 samples with 8q focal gains exhibited a common centromeric breakpoint within MYBL1 after exon 9, resulting in partial duplication of MYBL1 with truncation of its C-terminal negative-regulatory domain. Whole-genome sequencing of a MYBL1-rearranged DA2 demonstrated MYBL1 tandem duplication with the telomeric sequence located in MMP16. Truncated MYBL1 transcripts identified in this tumor induced anchorage-independent growth in 3T3 cells and tumor formation in nude mice. Truncated transcripts were also expressed in two additional DA2s with MYBL1 partial duplication. A similar recurrent deletion-truncation breakpoint was identified in two angiocentric gliomas (AGs) in the related gene MYB on 6q23.3. The results define clinically relevant molecular subclasses of diffuse PLGGs and highlight a potential role for the MYB family in the biology of low-grade gliomas.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
YWHAE YWHAE::NUTM2 mutation	YWHAE	NCBI:0	gene	Kidney Clear Cell Sarcoma	DOID:4880			Diagnostic				Pubmed:22294382	In this 2012 study O’Meara et al. included 51 clear cell sarcoma of kidney (CCSK). Using an index CCSK with the t(10;17)(q22;p13) identified by cytogenetics, they were able to map the breakpoints and identified the gene fusion transcript YHWAE::FAM22, currently known as YHWAE::NUTM2. Using RT-PCR they screened an additional 50 samples. Overall, fusion positive transcripts of YHWAE::NUTM2 were detected in 7/51 (14%) cases. Ages of the patients ranged from 0 to 6 years. This rearrangement produces an in-frame YWHAE::NUTM2 fusion transcript, comprising exons 1–5 of YWHAE and exons 2–7 of NUTM2. Of the 3 cases with RNA sufficient to sequence the entire coding region, the YWHAE fusion partner was identified as either NUTM2B (FAM22B) or NUTM2E (FAM22E). None of the transcript-positive cases presented with stage I disease, suggesting the fusion may be associated with poorer outcome.

Using RT-PCR with RNA extracted from FFPE  tumour tissue they detected a YWHAE::NUTM2 fusion transcript in 1/68 (1.5%) of cases. The majority of cases (54/68, 79%) had a BCOR ITD which is mutually exclusive with the YWHAE::NUTM2 fusion. The group generated a cell line model system in which inducible expression of YWHAE::NUTM2 could be used to identify reliable immunohistochemical markers. The study concluded that reliance on a single marker in CCSK is not ideal and suggested BCOR, TLE1 and CCND1 could be useful as a group of markers, with the YWHAE::NUTM2 case as well as BCOR-ITD cases staining strongly for all three of these markers, while  63 control samples from tumor types often considered in the differential diagnosis were negative or weakly staining.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

This patient was a 21 year old non-smoking male with adenocarcinoma, wt for KRAS and EGFR, negative for ALK copy number gain, who experienced crizotinib as a 2nd line therapy. The patient's best response on crizotinib was stable disease (377 days on treatment). In vitro, Ba/F3 cell line expressing EML4-ALK fusion (E6a;A20, a known sensitizing alteration) and ALK G1269A co-mutation demonstrated resistance to crizotinib treatment (341 nmol/L vs. 22 nmol/L) compared to Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK fusion. Resistance was determined by assessing cell viability and colony formation. Levels of phosphorylation of ALK, ERK, STAT3, and AKT were higher in ALK+ G1269A mutant cells than ALK+ controls, by western blot.

Primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS), and median PFS according to masked independent review was 14.7 months (95% CI 11.1–16.6) with dacomitinib group 9.2 months (9.1–11.0) with gefitinib (HR 0·59, 95% CI 0·47–0·74; p<0·0001).  Benefit of dacomitinib over gefitinib was lower in non-Asian patient subgroup (n=106) than in Asian group (n=346) although authors note smaller sample size may explain this. Authors state that PFS was significantly improved with first line dacomitinib treatment, and that dacomitinib should be considered for EGFR mutant NSCLC treatment.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

One ALK+ patient harbored the common E6;A20 fusion with ALK G1269A co-mutation in post-crizotinib progression biopsies. The presence of ALK G1269A pre-crizotinib could not be evaluated. This patient was a 21 year old non-smoking male with adenocarcinoma, wt for KRAS and EGFR, negative for ALK copy number gain, who experienced crizotinib as a 2nd line therapy. The patient's best response on crizotinib was stable disease (377 days on treatment). In vitro, Ba/F3 cell line expressing EML4-ALK fusion (E6a;A20, a known sensitizing alteration) and ALK G1269A co-mutation demonstrated resistance to crizotinib treatment (341 nmol/L vs. 22 nmol/L) compared to Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK fusion. Resistance was determined by assessing cell viability and colony formation. Levels of phosphorylation of ALK, ERK, STAT3, and AKT were higher in ALK+ G1269A mutant cells than ALK+ controls, by western blot.

On the other hand, the often used tool ALK inhibitor TAE684 was highly effective in killing H3122 CHR-A1, where H3122 cells were only slightly more sensitized to TAE684-induced cell death. Ectopic expression of EML4-ALK V1180L in Ba/F3 cells caused IL3 independent growth as well as marked sensitization to TAE684, to a level greater than that seen in EML4-ALK I1171T (alectinib resistance mutation) or EML4-ALK wt, and over 1000x greater sensitivity than unaltered Ba/F3 + IL3.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

Primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS), and median PFS according to masked independent review was 14.7 months (95% CI 11.1–16.6) with dacomitinib group 9.2 months (9.1–11.0) with gefitinib (HR 0·59, 95% CI 0·47–0·74; p<0·0001).  Benefit of dacomitinib over gefitinib was lower in non-Asian patient subgroup (n=106) than in Asian group (n=346) although authors note smaller sample size may explain this. Authors state that PFS was significantly improved with first line dacomitinib treatment, and that dacomitinib should be considered for EGFR mutant NSCLC treatment.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

EZH2 Y646N mutation	EZH2	NCBI:2146	gene	Follicular Lymphoma	DOID:50873			Predictive				Pubmed:34159682	This phase II study involved 17 Japanese adult patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (FL), previously treated with chemotherapy without an available standard therapy. The patients   harbored EZH2 activating mutations and were recruited to test the efficacy and safety of the EZH2 inhibitor- Tazemetostat. Tazemetostat was given at 800 mg dose twice a day for 28-days cycle. The objective response rate in this cohort was 76.5%, including six patients who had a complete response and seven who had partial response. The remaining three patients had stable disease status. Finally, the median progression‐free survival was not reached at the median follow‐up of 12.9 months. The authors highlight the efficacy and manageable safety profile of Tazemetostat in refractory/relapsed FL.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

The patient treated in a clinical trial with pan-TRK kinase inhibitor entrectinib. Treatment was well tolerated and led to a partial response (PR) with 30% tumor shrinkage of multiple liver metastases. Clinical response lasted 4 months. Longitudinal analysis of ctDNA in plasma samples revealed a p.G595R- and p.G667C mutation in NTRK1 that were absent before treatment initiation but  emerged 4 weeks upon initiation of treatment with entrectinib. These mutations were also validated using xenograft, in vitro and 3D-modeling.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

PIK3CA Exon 10 mutation	PIK3CA	NCBI:5290	gene	Colorectal Cancer	DOID:9256			Prognostic				Pubmed:22357840	This was a prospective study involving 1,170 colorectal cancer patients confirmed by histology. PIK3CA mutations were found in 16% (189/1170) of cased via pyrosequencing of FFPE samples, of these 58% (109/189) had mutations in exon 10, 39% (73/189) had mutations in exon 21, and 3.7% (7/189) had mutations in both exons. Study found that exon 10 + exon 21 mutants were associated with shorter cancer specific survival and overall survival when compared to WT PIK3CA (P = 0.031, P = 0.0008). These mutants were also associated with higher colorectal cancer-specific mortality and overall mortality (multivariate hazard ratio (HR) = 3.51, multivariate HR 2.68). In contrast, mutations on either exon 10 or exon 21 alone were not statistically significant in terms of overall survival. Note that exons 10 and 21 are listed as exons 9 and 20 in the source, as it was common at the time of its publication to exclude non-coding exon 1. Authors note that they had limited data on cancer treatment data, but assume that treatment regimens did not differ substantially based on PIK3CA mutation status given that patients were diagnosed prior to clinical availability of PIK3CA genotype data. They further note that treatment decisions were typically based on cancer stage, for which their analyses adjusted.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

PIK3CA Exon 10 mutation	PIK3CA	NCBI:5290	gene	Rectum Cancer	DOID:1993			Prognostic				Pubmed:19903786	This study examined outcomes of 240 rectum cancer patients treated with total mesorectal excision therapy. Tumor samples were obtained at the time of surgery and genotyped for PIK3CA mutations in exons 10 and 21 (listed as exons 9 and 20 in the source, as it was common to exclude non-coding exon 1). PIK3CA mutations were identified in 19 cases (12 in exon 10 and 7 in exon 21). PIK3CA mutations were associated with a 3-fold increase in risk of recurrence of rectal tumors (5-year risk: 27.8% vs 9.4%, p = 0.008). Furthermore, patients with PIK3CA mutations experienced a shorter time to recurrence compared to those with WT PIK3CA (median: 7.9 vs 19.6 months, p = 0.07). Patients with concomitant PIK3CA and KRAS mutations had a similar local reoccurrence rate to patients with PIK3CA mutations only. In multivariate analysis, PIK3A mutation was an independent predictor for the development of local recurrences (HR: 3.4, P =0.017).	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition

IKZF1 IKZF1 deletion	IKZF1	NCBI:10320	gene	Childhood B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia	DOID:80146			Prognostic				Pubmed:19129520	This study reports on two pediatric cohorts with B-ALL. In the first cohort of 221 high risk, BCR-ABL1-negative pediatric patients, 55.2% of IKZF1 positive patients had a hematologic relapse, 73.4% of IKZF1 positive patients had any relapse, and 74.6% of IKZF1 positive patients had an event (hematologic relapse, any relapse, a second malignant condition or death) as compared to 14%, 25.2%, and 27.1%, respectively, without an IKZF1 alteration. In a less selected cohort of 258 patients with both standard and high risk disease, with common aneuploidies including BCR-ABL1, 46.3% of IKZF1 positive patients had a hematologic relapse, 48.4% of IKZF1 positive patients had any relapse, and 60.5% of IKZF1 positive patients had an event as compared to 22.5%, 25.6%, and 27.6%, respectively, without an IKZF1 alteration. IKZF1 alteration is defined as a deletion or mutation in the gene. Gene expression profiles were found to be similar to BCR-ABL1 positive B-ALL, even when the BCR-ABL1 translocation was not present. The study concludes that IKZF1 alterations are associated with a very poor outcome in B-ALL.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity_id;assessed_biomarker_entity;condition
